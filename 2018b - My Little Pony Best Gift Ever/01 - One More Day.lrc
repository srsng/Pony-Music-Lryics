[00:07.22] [小马们]
[00:08.18]Hearth's Warming Eve is almost here
[00:09.80]There's so much left to do
[00:11.10] [云宝黛茜]
[00:11.38]Still need to shop for all my friends
[00:13.29]But what to get? No clue!
[00:14.45] [小蝶]
[00:14.79]This one is nice, and that's so cute
[00:16.22]Although that's pretty, too
[00:17.26] [瑞瑞]
[00:17.97]Why do I make all these gifts each year?
[00:22.76]I doubt I'll make it through
[00:24.73] [云宝黛茜、小蝶、瑞瑞]
[00:28.64]One more day before the cheer
[00:31.40] [小马们]
[00:31.76]Shop! Pay! Box! Wrap! Bow! Repeat!
[00:33.80] [云宝黛茜、小蝶、瑞瑞]
[00:34.69]One last chance before the holiday's here
[00:38.60] [小马们]
[00:38.87]Box! Wrap! Bow! Again!
[00:40.29] [云宝黛茜、小蝶、瑞瑞]
[00:40.57]One more day to make the holiday great
[00:42.85]One more day before we celebrate
[00:45.38] [瑞瑞]
[00:46.23]One day, and then it's here
[00:48.69] [云宝黛茜、小蝶、瑞瑞]
[00:49.00]One more chance to bring that holiday cheer
[00:52.55] [萍琪派]
[00:55.58]Hearth's Warming Eve is almost here
[00:57.17]A day for us to share
[00:58.28] [苹果杰克]
[00:59.04]Friends and family all together
[01:00.18] [萍琪派]
[01:00.74]Pies and Apples and a Pear
[01:01.84] [苹果杰克]
[01:02.31]Together families, lots of work
[01:03.67]There's so much to prepare
[01:05.06] [萍琪派、苹果杰克]
[01:05.57]With all the planning we still have to do
[01:10.18]We've got no time to spare
[01:12.32] [小马们]
[01:16.05]One more day before the cheer
[01:19.07]Stuff! Box! Wrap! Card! Bow! Repeat!
[01:19.12] [萍琪派]
[01:21.41] [小马们]
[01:22.21]One last chance before the holiday's here
[01:26.03] [萍琪派]
[01:26.39]Stir! Pour! Bake! Again!
[01:27.52]One more day to make the holiday bright
[01:30.23]One more day, and I can sleep at night
[01:33.38] [萍琪派、苹果杰克]
[01:33.47]The family's almost here
[01:36.75]One more chance to bring that holiday cheer

[01:43.43]Before the fun, there's preparation
[01:47.16](Just around the corner)
[01:49.79]Shopping, cooking, decoration
[01:53.26](The complications)
[01:55.22]It's all worth it in the end
[01:58.20]Spreading joy to all your friends
[02:01.22]Even when it never, ever
[02:03.62]Ever seems to end
[02:06.25]Aah!
[02:07.63] [斯派克]
[02:10.74]Hearth's Warming Eve is getting close
[02:12.26]We're not prepared, I fear
[02:13.86]Twilight, you should take a break
[02:15.42] [暮光闪闪]
[02:15.95]No time for rest, that much is clear
[02:17.06]I made a list and checked it twice
[02:18.68]There's lots to do on here
[02:20.36]Oh, if I can't get everything done
[02:25.18]I'll have to wait and celebrate next year
[02:30.89] [小马们]
[02:32.41]One more day before the cheer
[02:35.39]Shop! Pay! Box! Wrap! Bow! Repeat!
[02:38.47]One last chance before the holiday's here
[02:42.40]Box! Wrap! Bow! Again!
[02:43.89]One more day to make the holiday great
[02:46.76]One more day until we celebrate
[02:49.13] [可爱标记童子军]
[02:49.95]Please, oh, please make it really, really great!
[02:52.63]Parcel Post]
[02:53.07]One more gift, try to hurry, don't be late!
[02:55.84] [雏菊、蔷薇、Lily]
[02:56.22]Box! Wrap! Bow! Repeat! Gotta concentrate!
[02:58.52] [全体]
[02:59.24]Just one more day until we all celebrate!
