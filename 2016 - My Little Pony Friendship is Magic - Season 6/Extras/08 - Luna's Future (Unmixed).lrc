[00:31.58]I see a cold wind blowing through
[00:38.89]I see days neither fun nor free
[00:45.35]I see a future caused by you
[00:52.17]I see a path not meant to be
[01:26.09]The future should be filled with magic
[01:32.06]Dreams and wishes brought to life
[01:39.09]But the days ahead are dark and tragic
[01:46.31]No time for hope when all is strife
[01:53.20]Whatever might have been
[01:56.42]All the dreams that ponies share
[02:00.57]Because of you, Snowfall Frost
[02:03.54]Now the future is a cold nightmare
[03:57.37]I see a cold wind blowing through
[04:04.69]I see days neither fun nor free
[04:11.12]I see a future caused by you
[04:17.90]I see a path not meant to be
[04:51.62]The future should be filled with magic
[04:57.80]Dreams and wishes brought to life
[05:04.71]But the days ahead are dark and tragic
[05:12.03]No time for hope when all is strife
[05:18.81]The future should be filled with magic
[05:25.24]Dreams and wishes brought to life
[05:32.20]But the days ahead are dark and tragic
[05:39.49]No time for hope when all is strife
[05:46.46]Whatever might have been
[05:49.50]All the dreams that ponies share
[05:53.56]Because of you, Snowfall Frost
[05:56.74]Now the future is a cold nightmare
[06:00.30]Whatever might have been
[06:03.15]All the dreams that ponies share
[06:07.14]Because of you, Snowfall Frost
