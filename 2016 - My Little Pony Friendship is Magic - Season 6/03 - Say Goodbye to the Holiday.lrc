[00:10.10]Happy Hearth's Warming, they say in the street
[00:14.28]Happy Hearth's Warming, they think they're so sweet
[00:18.46]Words said so often that they lack any meaning
[00:22.40]Why should I join in when I could be intervening?
[00:26.36]Everypony loves this cursed holiday
[00:28.76]But would they be better off with it out of the way?
[00:36.56]Well, okay!
[00:41.44]Say goodbye to the holiday
[00:44.28]With my magic, I'll erase it
[00:48.34]The greatest gift that I give today
[00:51.26]And everypony will have to face it
[00:54.82]No more little games for you to play
[01:02.90]After you say goodbye to the holiday
[01:10.52]Goodbye, Hearth's Warming, you had a good run
[01:14.06]Goodbye, Hearth's Warming, it's over, you're done
[01:17.64]Finally set free from your forced celebrations
[01:21.24]No need to reply to your trite invitations
[01:24.82]Calendar shorter by a single day
[01:28.06]Is my magic up to the test?
[01:31.38]Time to see, I can't delay
[01:38.46]Say goodbye to the holiday
[01:41.64]Prepare the spell, no hesitation
[01:44.72]All memory shall fade away
[01:48.82]See Equestria's new transformation
[01:51.96]No more shall anypony say
[02:00.16]Happy Hearth's Warming...
[02:02.55](sinister laughter)
[02:04.64]...after today!
[02:12.50]After today...
