[00:03.03]在我还是小马的时候，每当太阳落下
[00:08.34]（Twilight Sparkle: Tell me she's not...）
[00:08.34]（紫悦：别告诉我她要）
[00:09.75]The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown...
[00:09.75]黑暗和影子总是让我皱眉头
[00:15.12]（Rarity: She is.）
[00:15.12]（珍奇：开始了。）
[00:16.17]I'd hide under my pillow
[00:16.17]我会躲在枕头底下
[00:18.21]From what I thought I saw
[00:18.21]胡思乱想好害怕
[00:20.52]But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way
[00:20.52]可奶奶告诉我
[00:22.77]To deal with fears at all
[00:22.77]光害怕这可不是办法
[00:24.75]（Rainbow Dash: Then what is?）
[00:24.75]（云宝：那怎么办？）
[00:25.71]She said: "Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall
[00:25.71]她说：“碧琪，你要勇敢的站起来
[00:28.98]Learn to face your fears
[00:28.98]怕什么就要面对什么
[00:30.72]You'll see that they can't hurt you just laugh to make them disappear."
[00:30.72]他们不能把你怎么样。笑一笑，害怕就不见了。”
[00:36.09]Ha! Ha! Ha!
[00:36.09]哈！哈！哈！
[00:37.65] [Ponies: gasp]
[00:39.30]So, giggle at the ghostly
[00:39.30]所以害怕你就傻笑
[00:41.52]Guffaw at the grossly
[00:41.52]再怕你就大笑
[00:43.71]Crack up at the creepy
[00:43.71]还怕你就爆笑
[00:45.93]Whoop it up with the weepy
[00:45.93]笑到不再悲伤
[00:48.06]Chortle at the kooky
[00:48.06]笑到忘记慌张
[00:50.22]Snortle at the spooky
[00:50.22]笑到心情欢畅
[00:52.38]And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... hahahaha... heh...
[00:52.38]告诉吓人的鬼脸快走开，别来烦我。要是他以为他能吓到你，他就打错算盘了。因为这种事只会让你想要：哈哈哈哈哈哈！
[01:03.00]Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuugh!
[01:03.00]笑！
