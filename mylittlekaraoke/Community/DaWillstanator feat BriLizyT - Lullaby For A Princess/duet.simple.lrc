[00:03.92][P2] How could I have done this?
[00:07.15][P1] Please sister, forgive me!
[00:11.35][P2] I'm sorry!
[00:15.51][P1] Fate has been cru-u-u-el a-and order unkind
[00:21.36][P1] How can I have sent you away?
[00:26.46][P2] Just rest easy now, the punishment's mine
[00:32.39][P2] The darkness and silence pre-evade
[00:37.52][P1] Bu-ut into the sti-illness I'll bring you a song
[00:43.23][P1] And I will your company ke-ep
[00:48.29][P2] Through your tire-ed eyes, your sweet lullabies
[00:53.99][P2] Will carry me softly-y to-o sleep
[01:11.84][P1] Once did a pony who-o shone like the sun
[01:16.22][P1] Look out on her ki-ingdom and sigh
[01:21.06][P2] She smi-led and said, "Surely, there is nopony
[01:25.97][P2] So lovely and so-o well beloved as I"
[01:34.49][P1] So great was he-er reign and so brilliant her glo-ory-y
[01:34.49][P2] So great was her reign and so brilliant her glo-ory-y
[01:39.51][P1] That long wa-as the shado-ow she cast
[01:39.55][P2] That long wa-as the shado-ow she cast
[01:44.28][P2] Which fell dark upon the young siste-er you loved
[01:49.15][P1] And grew only darke-er as days and nights passed
[01:49.19][P2] And grew only darke-er as days and nights passed
[01:58.00][P1] Lullay moon princess, goodnight siste-er mine
[02:02.95][P1] Rest now in moonlight's embrace
[02:08.16][P2] I'll bear thy lullaby, winds o-of the earth
[02:12.47][P2] Through cloud and through sky and through space
[02:17.76][P1] Carry the peace and the coolness of night
[02:17.76][P2] Carry the peace a-and the coolness of night
[02:22.15][P1] I-I'll carry thy sorro-ow in ki-i-i-ind
[02:22.22][P2] I-I'll carry thy sorro-ow in kind
[02:27.47][P1] Luna, yo-u're loved so much mo-ore than you know
[02:32.05][P2] Forgive me for being so blind
[02:39.62][P1] Soon did that pony take notice that others
[02:44.05][P1] Did not give her sister her due
[02:48.93][P2] And neither had you loved me as I deserved
[02:53.84][P2] You watched as my rage and unhappiness grew
[03:02.39][P1] But such is the wa-ay of the limelight, it swe-etly-y
[03:02.39][P2] But such is the way of the limelight, it sweetly
[03:07.22][P1] Took hold o-of the mi-i-ind o-of its host
[03:07.22][P2] Took hold of the mind o-of its host
[03:12.06][P1] And both foolish ponies did nothi-ing to stop
[03:12.14][P2] And both foolish ponies did nothi-ing to stop
[03:16.94][P1] The destruction of one who had needed her most
[03:25.82][P2] Lullay sun princess, goodnight siste-er mine
[03:30.66][P2] Rest now in moonlight's embrace
[03:35.57][P1] Bear up my-y lullaby, winds o-of the earth
[03:40.00][P2] Through cloud and through sky and through space
[03:40.07][P1] Through cloud, and through sky, a-and through space
[03:45.29][P1] Carry the peace a-and the coolness of night
[03:45.32][P2] Carry the peace and the coolness of night
[03:49.79][P1] And carry my sorro-ow in kind
[03:49.82][P2] And carry my sorro-ow in ki-i-i-ind
[03:55.07][P2] Tia, you loved me much more than I knew
[03:59.54][P1] May trouble-es be fa-ar from your mi-i-ind
[04:06.40][P2] And forgive me for being so blind
[04:06.44][P1] And forgive me fo-or being so blind
[04:21.51][P2] Oh, dear Tia!
[04:26.95][P2]  I know not what I did
[04:32.20][P2] Please! Forgive me!
[04:36.74][P1] The years now be-e-fo-ore us
[04:36.74][P2] The years no-ow be-efo-ore us
[04:43.00][P2] Empty and unknown
[04:43.04][P1] Empty-y a-and unknown
[04:47.73][P2] I ne-eve-er ima-agined
[04:47.76][P1] I ne-eve-er i-ima-agined
[04:53.54][P1] We'd face them a-all a-alone
[04:53.57][P2] We'd face them all a-alone
[04:58.49][P2] May the-ese tho-usand wi-inters
[04:58.56][P1] May these tho-usand wi-inters
[05:04.64][P1] Swiftly-y pass, I pr-ay
[05:04.68][P2] Swiftly pass, I pray
[05:09.44][P1] I love you, I miss you
[05:09.51][P2] I love you, I miss you
[05:16.07][P1] A-all these miles away
[05:16.11][P2] All these miles a-away
[05:24.74][P2] May all your dreams be sweet tonight
[05:34.98][P1] Safe upon your be-ed of moonlight
[05:43.94][P1] And know not of he-a-artache, pain, o-or care
[05:44.01][P2] And know not of heartache, pain, o-or care
[05:53.16][P2] And whe-en I dream, I'll fly-y away and meet you there
[05:53.20][P1] And when I-I dream I'll fly away and meet you there
[06:02.65][P1] Sleep, sleep, sle-ep...
[06:02.65][P2] Sleep, sleep, sle-ep...
