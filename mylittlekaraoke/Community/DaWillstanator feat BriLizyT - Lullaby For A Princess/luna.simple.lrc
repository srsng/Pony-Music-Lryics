[00:03.92]How could I have done this?
[00:11.35]I'm sorry!
[00:26.46]Just rest easy now, the punishment's mine
[00:32.39]The darkness and silence pre-evade
[00:48.29]Through your tire-ed eyes, your sweet lullabies
[00:53.99]Will carry me softly-y to-o sleep
[01:21.06]She smi-led and said, "Surely, there is nopony
[01:25.97]So lovely and so-o well beloved as I"
[01:34.49]So great was her reign and so brilliant her glo-ory-y
[01:39.55]That long wa-as the shado-ow she cast
[01:44.28]Which fell dark upon the young siste-er you loved
[01:49.19]And grew only darke-er as days and nights passed
[02:08.16]I'll bear thy lullaby, winds o-of the earth
[02:12.47]Through cloud and through sky and through space
[02:17.76]Carry the peace a-and the coolness of night
[02:22.22]I-I'll carry thy sorro-ow in kind
[02:32.05]Forgive me for being so blind
[02:48.93]And neither had you loved me as I deserved
[02:53.84]You watched as my rage and unhappiness grew
[03:02.39]But such is the way of the limelight, it sweetly
[03:07.22]Took hold of the mind o-of its host
[03:12.14]And both foolish ponies did nothi-ing to stop
[03:25.82]Lullay sun princess, goodnight siste-er mine
[03:30.66]Rest now in moonlight's embrace
[03:40.00]Through cloud and through sky and through space
[03:45.32]Carry the peace and the coolness of night
[03:49.82]And carry my sorro-ow in ki-i-i-ind
[03:55.07]Tia, you loved me much more than I knew
[04:06.40]And forgive me for being so blind
[04:21.51]Oh, dear Tia!
[04:26.95] I know not what I did
[04:32.20]Please! Forgive me!
[04:36.74]The years no-ow be-efo-ore us
[04:43.00]Empty and unknown
[04:47.73]I ne-eve-er ima-agined
[04:53.57]We'd face them all a-alone
[04:58.49]May the-ese tho-usand wi-inters
[05:04.68]Swiftly pass, I pray
[05:09.51]I love you, I miss you
[05:16.11]All these miles a-away
[05:24.74]May all your dreams be sweet tonight
[05:44.01]And know not of heartache, pain, o-or care
[05:53.16]And whe-en I dream, I'll fly-y away and meet you there
[06:02.65]Sleep, sleep, sle-ep...
