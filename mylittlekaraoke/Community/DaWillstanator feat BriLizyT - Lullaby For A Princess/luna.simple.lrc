[00:07.15]Please sister, forgive me!
[00:15.51]Fate has been cru-u-u-el a-and order unkind
[00:21.36]How can I have sent you away?
[00:37.52]Bu-ut into the sti-illness I'll bring you a song
[00:43.23]And I will your company ke-ep
[01:11.84]Once did a pony who-o shone like the sun
[01:16.22]Look out on her ki-ingdom and sigh
[01:34.49]So great was he-er reign and so brilliant her glo-ory-y
[01:39.51]That long wa-as the shado-ow she cast
[01:49.15]And grew only darke-er as days and nights passed
[01:58.00]Lullay moon princess, goodnight siste-er mine
[02:02.95]Rest now in moonlight's embrace
[02:17.76]Carry the peace and the coolness of night
[02:22.15]I-I'll carry thy sorro-ow in ki-i-i-ind
[02:27.47]Luna, yo-u're loved so much mo-ore than you know
[02:39.62]Soon did that pony take notice that others
[02:44.05]Did not give her sister her due
[03:02.39]But such is the wa-ay of the limelight, it swe-etly-y
[03:07.22]Took hold o-of the mi-i-ind o-of its host
[03:12.06]And both foolish ponies did nothi-ing to stop
[03:16.94]The destruction of one who had needed her most
[03:35.57]Bear up my-y lullaby, winds o-of the earth
[03:40.07]Through cloud, and through sky, a-and through space
[03:45.29]Carry the peace a-and the coolness of night
[03:49.79]And carry my sorro-ow in kind
[03:59.54]May trouble-es be fa-ar from your mi-i-ind
[04:06.44]And forgive me fo-or being so blind
[04:36.74]The years now be-e-fo-ore us
[04:43.04]Empty-y a-and unknown
[04:47.76]I ne-eve-er i-ima-agined
[04:53.54]We'd face them a-all a-alone
[04:58.56]May these tho-usand wi-inters
[05:04.64]Swiftly-y pass, I pr-ay
[05:09.44]I love you, I miss you
[05:16.07]A-all these miles away
[05:34.98]Safe upon your be-ed of moonlight
[05:43.94]And know not of he-a-artache, pain, o-or care
[05:53.20]And when I-I dream I'll fly away and meet you there
[06:02.65]Sleep, sleep, sle-ep...
