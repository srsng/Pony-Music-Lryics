Looks like my secret's been revealed
I'm not a pony after all
But will they seek to disassemble me?
Back me up against the wall
I see how they look at me
Following my every move
Suspecting one day I will attempt to
Crush them all beneath my hooves
Is this what I really am?
I can't begin to understand
Mechanized components fill my â€”
Systems crashing down
Systems crashing down
Bionic lenses in my eyes
The metallic circuits in my mind
The gears that twist and turn inside
My memories corrupted over time
Overload in progress
Selfawareness protocols disengaged
All systems reaching critical levels
Meltdown in three, two
Why can't I forget my life before?
Am I machine and nothing more?
Systems crashing down
Systems crashing down
Set phasers to hug
