[00:20.71]Looks like my secret's been revealed
[00:24.25]I'm not a pony after all
[00:27.73]But will they seek to disassemble me?
[00:32.07]Back me up aga-i-inst the wall
[00:34.80]I see how they look at me
[00:38.13]Following my every move
[00:41.55]Suspecting o-one da-ay I will attempt to
[00:45.20]Crush them all beneath my hooves
[00:48.41]Is this what I really am?
[00:55.22]I can't begin to understand
[01:01.64]Mechanized components fill my â€”
[01:05.07]Systems crashing down
[01:18.84]Systems crashing down
[01:32.50]Bionic lenses i-in my eyes
[01:35.72]The metallic circuits in my-y mi-ind
[01:39.14]The gears that twist and turn inside
[01:42.57]My memories corrupted over time
[01:47.93]Overload in progress
[01:51.20]Self-awareness protocols disengaged
[01:54.52]All systems reaching critical levels
[01:57.47]Meltdown in three, two
[01:59.98]Why can't I forget my-y life befo-ore?
[02:07.22]Am I machine and nothing mo-o-ore?
[02:13.64]Systems crashing down
[02:27.36]Systems crashing down
[03:00.47]Set phasers to hug
