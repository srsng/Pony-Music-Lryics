[00:18.29]Being
[00:20.55]Faith~~ful~
[00:22.27]Is easy
[00:26.55]When you're winning~
[00:30.24]No one ever~ leaves
[00:35.94]But when
[00:38.79]Cha~os~
[00:42.58]Starts to gather
[00:44.84]They will let you down~~
[00:49.47]You will see
[00:53.99]The~ thunder~
[00:58.51]I can make it
[01:03.14]Like if the drums of war~~
[01:07.66]Could rain down~
[01:11.50]And~ with pops like guns~~
[01:16.81]Fire~ sweetness
[01:20.60]To the mouths of the hungry ones~
[01:25.42]When they come around
[01:31.47]One~
[01:33.09]By one
[01:35.50]They~ joined me~~
[01:40.61]All~ at a time~ they treat you bad~
[01:49.76]Do~
[01:51.48]You feel~ your power slipping~
[01:57.97]I can't take~
[02:01.71]What you never~ had
[02:08.01]E~ven in play~
[02:12.28]It's war that you~ made~
[02:16.32]And your penance~
[02:21.24]Is Discord~
[02:26.35]Color fades away~
[02:30.58]You know you lost the~ game~
[02:34.61]And the winner~
[02:39.48]Is Discord~
[02:44.01]You can cry but I won't feel~
[02:48.63]It's reality I~ steal~
[02:53.69]What will you do~ now~
[02:57.73]With Discord~

[03:16.07]With Discord~
