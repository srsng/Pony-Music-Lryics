Can you see me?
As you walk right through my heart~ache
As you glance beyond the steps I take
My eyes to be awake
Can you hear me?
When I say my heart's~ about to break
When I can't sort out this stomachache
It's a feeling that I can't take
And I call~ for you~
And I wish you would too
So I hold~ to a dream~ I never had~
And I think to myself it's not so~ bad
I'm breaking
And oh my knees are sha~king
And I can't speak a syllable
I feel so~ invisible
Cause it seems to me
That the more I try
The more I see
The less I under~stand
And I call~ for you~
And I wish you would too
So I hold~ to a dream~ I never had~
And I think to myself it's not so~ bad
