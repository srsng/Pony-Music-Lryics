[00:00.06]Hey!
[00:16.02]Rarity, oh can't you see
[00:18.19]Why I need you?
[00:19.64]I'm waiting in the dark for a spark
[00:21.93]Just to see you
[00:23.55]If light is what you want
[00:25.06]Then I'll brighten your world
[00:26.93]In a blaze
[00:31.39]Rarity, oh count the hours
[00:33.79]'Cause a storm is coming
[00:35.30]Maybe we could hold it off
[00:37.53]'stead of only running
[00:39.10]We could make the world stand still
[00:41.69]For hours or days
[00:46.75]Darkness
[00:47.95]You've been holding out for something you know
[00:50.90]It's not the best
[00:52.11]But I promise it's the brightest
[00:54.52]Darkness
[00:55.66]Just you wait; you'll have
[00:57.41]No place to go
[00:58.61]And we'll show you, we'll show you we'll glow~~
[01:02.11]Maybe if that's what you want
[01:04.58]We can start a fire
[01:06.57]And ignite the dark
[01:09.34]And maybe if we just try
[01:12.23]We can find it all
[01:14.22]In between the lines
[01:24.70]Hey!
[01:32.83]Rarity, oh can't we wait
[01:35.24]Just a moment longer
[01:36.75]How can I just say goodbye
[01:39.10]And not start to wonder
[01:40.66]What my life would come to be
[01:43.19]Without your~ voice?
[01:48.07]Rarity, imagine how
[01:50.60]We could live forever
[01:52.17]Drifting through this crazy world
[01:54.52]Holding on together
[01:55.96]We could make the perfect match
[01:58.61]But it's your~ choice
[02:03.61]Darkness
[02:04.88]You've been holding out for something you know
[02:07.83]It's not the best
[02:08.92]But I promise it's the brightest
[02:11.45]Darkness
[02:12.53]Just you wait; you'll have no place to go
[02:15.48]And we'll show you, we'll show you we'll glow~~
[02:19.04]Maybe if that's what you~ want
[02:21.45]We can start a fire
[02:23.37]And ignite the dark
[02:26.39]And maybe if we just try
[02:29.16]We can find it all
[02:31.02]In between the lines
[02:41.57]Hey
[03:04.70]Hey, hey, hey, hey, ... hey
