[00:27.84]Friends, keep that bonfire burning bright
[00:31.09]Been a while but I'm coming home tonight
[00:35.19]To the place where I belong
[00:40.84]Made my mistakes but I'll make them right
[00:44.14]We'll be drinkin' cider 'til the morning light
[00:48.19]When you're with me we can't go wrong
[00:53.59]Oh~, oh~, I'm coming home, coming home
[01:02.14]I'm coming home~
[01:06.54]Oh~, ooh oh~~
[01:13.54]I'm coming home, I'm coming home~
[01:19.59]And I thought I might've learned my lesson by now
[01:25.44]But I keep running away
[01:28.69]From the very ones who make life worth the pain
[01:32.79]Will you take me back?
[01:35.19]As I'm running home~ to you
[01:38.59]I know you know~ I'm sorry
[01:41.69]And I'm lost without you
[02:36.84]Remem~ber me, my dearest friends
[02:44.94]And the times we spent together
[02:49.79]For a thou~sand years
[02:53.04]'Til the sun burns out~~
[02:57.94]We'll still be friends forever
