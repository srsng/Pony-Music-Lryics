[00:08.12]She looks outside her window at the rising sun
[00:11.70]And she also looks at the same time at her beloved one
[00:16.10]Dinky's sorting out the mail for her
[00:18.58]In such a thoughtful way
[00:23.53]She saddles up her bags and
[00:25.80]Peeks in the looking glass and hears her daughter say
[00:30.14]"Hey Mommy, can you see how good you look today
[00:34.06]Your right eye has a sparkle and the left one wants to play
[00:38.46]Your mane looks extra shiny and your feathers extra soft
[00:45.07]Your cutie mark reminds me that our love will never pop!"
[00:49.20]Oh-oh-oh, Ditzy Doo!
[00:51.33]All the world's in love with you
[00:53.53]It's like you're a fresh-baked muffin
[00:55.80]And the rest of us are you
[00:57.94]Ah-ah-ah, Derpy!
[01:00.14]Tell me, can those bright eyes see
[01:02.89]You make living happier for everypony
[01:08.67]She takes off down the road in
[01:10.87]Search of the day's first home and
[01:13.00]Although it takes a moment she spots the boutique
[01:17.55]A white mare canters out and
[01:19.61]Her lips rise from a pout when
[01:21.88]She cannot help but shout "Hello!" to that gray streak
[01:26.35]Then in the marketplace where
[01:28.49]Every eye knows her face she's
[01:30.69]Greeted by their good grace and she has none to spare
[01:35.09]A farm mare selling apples tosses our friend a hatful
[01:39.56]It's more than she can grapple, but she thanks the mare
[01:43.97]Though she's a little wonky, each pony and each donkey
[01:48.44]Together and all on key sing for her a song
[01:53.12]Oh-oh-oh Ditzy Doo!
[01:55.25]All the world's in love with you
[01:57.39]It's like you're a fresh-baked muffin
[01:59.86]And the rest of us are you
[02:01.93]Ah-ah-ah, Derpy!
[02:04.33]Tell me can those bright eyes see
[02:06.81]You make living happier for everypony
[02:28.56]It wasn't that long ago that I didn't know
[02:30.83]Who I was going to become
[02:32.82]I thought I saw the whole world laid out in front of me
[02:35.09]And I couldn't be any more scared than that
[02:37.16]I saw a world full of dark, no color, no light, no laughter
[02:40.32]Well, we've all been there right?
[02:41.97]Out of the dark, six kind souls came into my life
[02:45.21]And this is what they said:
[02:46.03]"You've gotta bring back the kid inside, full of innocence
[02:48.65]Don't be afraid, spread your love like Cadence
[02:50.92]You've got a ways left to go
[02:53.19]But it won't hurt to let it show"
[03:13.49]Oh-oh-oh, Ditzy Doo!
[03:15.62]All the world's in love with you
[03:17.82]It's like you're a fresh-baked muffin
[03:20.09]And the rest of us are you
[03:22.22]Ah-ah-ah, Derpy!
[03:24.43]Tell me, can those bright eyes see
[03:27.18]You make living happier for everypony
[03:30.96]Oh-oh-oh, Ditzy Doo!
[03:33.10]All the world's in love with you
[03:35.30]It's like you're a fresh-baked muffin
[03:37.57]and the rest of us are you
[03:39.70]Ah-ah-ah, Derpy!
