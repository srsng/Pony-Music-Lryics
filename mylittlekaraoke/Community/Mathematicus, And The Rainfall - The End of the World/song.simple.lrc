[00:39.59]Twilight is searching for
[00:42.37]Stars to fill her sky
[00:45.24]White light blinds her
[00:47.84]The sun is far too~ bright
[00:50.89]Dark night brings her
[00:53.53]To somewhere deep inside
[00:56.58]Twilight is searching
[00:59.14]For something she can't find~
[01:24.72]Something strange has happened to
[01:27.37]The flowers and the trees
[01:30.41]This is not, is not, the time
[01:33.06]For them to change their leaves~
[01:36.06]Something strange has happened to
[01:38.62]The flowers and the trees
[01:41.66]This is not, is not, the time
[01:44.31]For them to change their leaves~
[01:58.25]So Twilight wanders through
[02:01.43]Letters she can't write
[02:04.25]Time stands still when she
[02:07.08]Looks into her eyes
[02:09.94]Twilight's tears flow
[02:12.55]And pools reflect her~ light
[02:15.59]Try as she might
[02:18.24]She cannot calm the tides~
[02:55.08]Something strange has happened to
[02:57.72]The rainbow in the sky
[03:00.55]The light has cast a shadow and
[03:03.37]The colors aren't quite right
[03:06.41]Something strange has happened to
[03:09.06]The rainbow in the~ sky
[03:11.84]The light has cast a shadow and
[03:14.53]The colors aren't quite right~~
[03:39.90]As Twilight is burning up
[03:42.90]A fire~ she can't~ fight
[03:45.94]Crystal trees shine
[03:48.55]With leaves as sharp as knives
[03:51.64]Ink and graphite
[03:54.19]Become the darkest light
[03:57.19]Twilight takes flight
[03:59.84]She cannot bear to cry~
[04:02.84]Something strange has happened to
[04:05.49]The sun, the moon and stars
[04:08.31]The constellations vanished, but
[04:11.00]Their light has left a scar
[04:14.14]Something strange has happened to
[04:16.78]The sun, the moon and stars
[04:19.65]The constellations vanished, but
[04:22.34]Their light has left a scar
[04:36.41]But Twi~light is fading as
[04:39.50]Darkness fills the sky
[04:42.37]Moonlight is dripping in-
[04:45.24]To her violet eyes
[04:48.06]Starlight is singing
[04:50.71]A lonely lullaby
[04:53.66]Daylight is dancing
[04:56.31]Away from paradise~
[05:21.90]Something strange has happened to
[05:24.64]The rivers and the sea
[05:27.41]The water's standing still
[05:29.66]And reflections can't be seen
[05:33.19]Something strange has happened to
[05:35.89]The rivers and the~ sea
[05:38.62]The water's standing still
[05:40.91]And reflections can't be seen
[06:07.12]Ah ah ah
[06:18.41]Ah ah ah
[06:29.71]Ah ah ah
[06:35.40]Ah ah ah ah
[06:40.61]Now Twilight is sleeping as
[06:43.87]Memories pass her~ by
[06:52.30]Sun follows moonshine
[06:54.99]The beauty of the~ night
[06:57.94]Twilight is ending
[07:00.59]And so she says goodbye
