[00:43.33]You see me soaring through the sky
[00:46.00]I see you below as you walk on by
[00:48.67]I could clear the sky in ten seconds flat
[00:51.33]How about that? How about tha-at?
[00:54.00]I could be sitting here on a cloud
[00:56.75]Watching the sun as it starts to go down
[00:59.58]The only thing missing
[01:01.33]Is you by my side
[01:04.67]Give me a smidge of confide-ence
[01:07.42]Give me a speck of something that makes sense
[01:10.33]Give me an idea of dependency
[01:12.67]Give me a dash of loya-alty~~
[01:19.08]Loyalty~
[01:26.33]I could save my lonely soul for you~~~
[01:30.58]But the feeling in my heart can't follow through
[01:37.08]You can give your broken heart to me~~~
[01:41.17]'Cause you know that I'll stay with you
[01:44.08]That's why they call me loyalty~
[01:51.00]Loyalty
[01:58.00]The sun shines bri-ight, yet the rain pours on
[02:00.67]Rainbows here one minute and then they're gone
[02:03.42]They remind me of me and you
[02:06.00]What did you do? What did I do-o?
[02:08.75]Determination in those eyes
[02:11.42]Where has it gone? Has it said goodbye?
[02:14.33]A lot has happened
[02:16.00]But I'll stay by your side
[02:19.33]Give me a smidge of confidence
[02:22.08]Give me a speck of something that makes sense
[02:25.00]Give me an idea of dependency
[02:27.42]Give me a dash of loyalty~~
[02:33.75]Loyalty~

[02:55.92]'Cause you know that I'll stay with you~

[03:02.42]Time stands still when you're with~ me
[03:07.42]How can I make you se-e-e?
[03:12.08]Your crazy antics make me want to scream
[03:17.33]Your name so loud till my throat starts to~ bleed
