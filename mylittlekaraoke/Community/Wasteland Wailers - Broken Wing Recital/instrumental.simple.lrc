[00:07.17]Well I bit the bullet, I drunk it dry
[00:12.37]My heart~ is spillin' over the sides
[00:17.64]Of a tall glass of whiskey that's killin' the pain~~
[00:22.92]My wings were broken, all feathers and flame
[00:28.80]Heart pumping black and blue, swirling down~ the pit
[00:34.31]I ain't been me since Zephyr came and went
[00:42.45]They told me I would fly
[00:47.76]They told me I would fly~~
[00:53.08]A talent I received
[00:58.48]But that didn't keep her with me
[01:01.25]My mind's full of your déjà vu~
[01:03.79]But it ain't curin' my broken wing blues~
[01:08.46]The columns of my city, in youth I would spend
[01:13.54]Twixt ivory chute and slalom with Zephyr, my first friend
[01:19.05]Stripe war poised to strangle, but fringe to fringe we knew~
[01:24.21]The pair of us would scare us up a victory or two~
[01:29.60]For sun and moon and country, it ends, we all go home
[01:34.76]One mortar shell shot that to hell, now ground-bound I'm alone~~~~
[01:46.23]They told me I would fly
[01:51.43]They told me I would fly~~
[01:56.74]The treatment I received didn't bring her~~ back to me~
[02:05.00]My mind's full of your déjà vu,~
[02:07.50]But it ain't curin' my broken wing blues~
[02:12.25]Doctors pumped me full of magic, spruced me up real good
[02:17.24]My burnt wings strapped to plastic, a shiny hoof out of wood
[02:23.00]They say I'm fixed, done with healin', but
[02:25.37]Losing my wingmare's got me feelin'
[02:27.99]Only you can break this ceiling
[02:30.65]And every second's time~ I'm stealin'~~
[02:45.07]They told me I would fly~~~~~~
[02:50.34]They told me I would fly~~~~~~~
[02:55.62]They told~ me a lie~~~~~~
[03:00.97]It hurts to laugh~
[03:02.86]When six feet under's~ my better half~
[03:06.45]You can bury me there too, through this bottle
[03:10.76]I'll follow you and finally be through~
[03:14.50]With these broken wing~~~~~~ blues~
[03:28.56]Broken wing blues~~~~~
[03:33.71]Broken wing~ blues~~~~~
