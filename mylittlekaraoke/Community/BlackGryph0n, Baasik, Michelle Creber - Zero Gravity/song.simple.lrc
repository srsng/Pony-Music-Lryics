[00:15.54]I'm taken by this feeling and I'm losing the fight
[00:18.99]I'm falling, feeling, faster we go
[00:23.15]Surrender to this moment like the day to the night
[00:26.55]I'm fal~ling, fal~ling, faster we go
[00:35.06]I'm getting tired of the running, the screaming, the fighting
[00:38.93]I feel it following me everywhere I go
[00:42.68]I see it in their faces, every place is bleeding it
[00:46.55]And I am breathing it
[00:48.39]I am a piece of it
[00:50.36]And we can't live without the fashion, the passion
[00:53.27]It's catching us with no reaction and it's everywhere we go
[00:57.98]We just keep holding on, afraid of just releasing it
[01:01.78]There's no defeating it
[01:03.69]Can we find peace with it?
[01:05.18]I'm taken by this feeling and I'm losing the fight
[01:08.51]I'm fal~ling, feel~ing, faster we go
[01:12.68]Surrender to this moment like the day to the night
[01:16.07]I'm fal~ling, fal~ling, faster we go
[01:20.06]It's your life
[01:20.83]And it's the only one that you'll ever get
[01:23.51]Do you feel alive?
[01:24.70]And are you making the most of it?
[01:27.26]It's your life
[01:28.45]And you're the only one that you'll ever be
[01:31.13]Do you feel alive?
[01:32.26]And can you handle Zero Gravity?
[01:36.07]When you are up here there is nowhere to look but down
[01:39.88]Forget it all and let the silence around, sur~round
[01:43.69]Step off, and step away from the sound
[01:46.49]I've found the world looks smaller when you're miles~ above the~ ground
[01:51.31]Free-fall, loose it all, like you're ten feet~ tall
[01:55.12]You can't be someone â€˜till you're no one at all
[01:57.98]And say "Hey, can't you see what it's doing to me?
[02:01.78]I may be losing my mind, but at least I'm free!"
[02:06.07]I'm taken by this feeling and I'm losing the fight
[02:09.40]I'm falling, feeling, faster we go
[02:13.69]Surrender to this moment like the day to the night
[02:17.02]I'm fal~ling, fal~ling, faster we go
[02:28.45]Hey hey hey
[02:36.01]It's your life
[02:37.02]And it's the only one that you'll ever get
[02:39.76]Do you feel alive?
[02:40.83]And are you making the most of it?
[02:43.45]It's your life
[02:44.64]And you're the only one that you'll ever be
[02:47.26]Do you feel alive?
[02:48.45]And can you handle Zero Gravity?
[02:51.19]It's your life
[02:52.26]And it's the only one that you'll ever get
[02:55.00]Do you feel alive?
[02:56.13]And are you making the most of it?
[02:58.75]It's your life
[02:59.88]And you're the only one that you'll ever be
[03:02.62]Do you feel alive?
[03:03.69]And can you handle Zero Gravity?
