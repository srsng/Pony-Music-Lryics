I close my eyes and I see you
You hypnotize me in my dreams~
I can feel it in my chest
A heart that beats for two
I can hear the sound of other screams~
And as the smoke begins to clear
The dust settles on the ground~
You're all I need beside me
Just stay near and I am found
I am found
I am found
I am found
And I am found
Stay~
Stay~
They're all around but I don't care~
And they can't hurt me anymore~
We're in our own world now
Together we are here
And our love can finally soar~~
And as we rise up
None will dare to bring us down
You're all I need beside me
Just stay near and I am found
I am found
I am found
I am found
And I am found
Stay~
Stay~
