[00:28.16]One would believe in simple means
[00:30.64]Some would believe it possible
[00:33.13]Others feel it won't be seen
[00:35.35]For none believe in miracles
[00:38.15]Some give a diamond for a stone
[00:40.64]Some give a stone for a di-iamond
[00:43.13]Some keep a-all things for their own
[00:45.31]And some remain in si-ilence
[01:07.83]There once lived a girl in a simpler time
[01:10.32]With night-like hair and skin so white
[01:12.92]Wherever she went, everyone she'd tell
[01:15.30]"What appears as mine, 'tis thi-ine as well"
[01:17.83]So she went through the world giving all she had
[01:20.28]Never feeling the need to claim it back
[01:22.84]Everyone she'd meet would befall her spell
[01:25.33]"What appears as mine, 'tis thi-ine as well"
[01:28.17]Counting the days of a shortening life
[01:30.66]Living the ways of a nursery rhyme
[01:33.15]Humming the tune of a ringing bell
[01:35.29]What appears as mine, 'tis thi-ine as well
[02:08.16]One would believe in simple means
[02:10.65]Some would believe it possible
[02:13.14]Others feel it won't be seen
[02:15.31]For none believe in miracles
[02:18.19]Some give a diamond for a stone
[02:20.64]Some give a stone for a di-iamond
[02:23.13]Some keep a-all things for their own
[02:25.35]And some remain in silence
[02:32.00]Oo-ooh Ah
[02:37.49]Oo-ooh Ah
[02:43.09]Ah-ah-ah-ah Ah
