[01:00.70]Lions~ surround me~
[01:04.03]Eyeing me with hungry eyes~
[01:05.99]Their~ teeth their lies~~
[01:11.36]Why risk the heartache~
[01:14.70]I'll just keep my head to the books~
[01:16.70]My~ back to the skies~~
[01:21.99]The way looks rough~
[01:27.11]But I think~ I'll make it
[01:30.03]If I just take my time~~
[01:33.70]So you go your way
[01:36.32]And I'll go mine~
[01:38.49]But some~ days~
[01:43.32]I look out and pray~~~~~
[01:48.70]I won't have to stay~
[01:52.86]All alone~ unknown
[02:04.32]How~ could I walk this path alone~
[02:07.53]I would have fallen without you~
[02:10.57]To walk beside me and~
[02:12.70]Lift me up when I'm down
[02:15.36]I am alive~~
[02:18.53]Because~ of your generosity
[02:20.86]Your loyalty your honesty
[02:23.36]Laughter kindness and love
[02:25.99]You took~ my heart~
[02:30.95]Said it could~ be more
[02:33.66]Than worn and broken and scarred
[02:37.70]And when I'm alone
[02:40.20]You taught me to sing
[02:42.70]Who~ knows~~~?
[02:47.36]Maybe you~ and yours~~~~
[02:52.45]Are star~ing outdoors~
[02:56.78]At the same~ rainbows
[03:04.03]Who~ knows?
[03:08.70]Maybe you~ and yours~
[03:13.66]Are star~ing outdoors~
[03:18.20]At the same~ rainbows
[03:23.45]At the same~ rainbows
[03:28.82]At the same~ rainbows
[03:34.07]At the same~ rainbows
