There is no feeling inside I can call my own
I cannot reap the seeds that I've never spoke
Even if it feels like this body is real
I've got to face the truth and fulfill my destiny
I am just a memory of a life I've never lived
I am just a memory of the gifts I cannot give
And even if I wanted to
I could never be like you
There is nothing to be
I am just a memory
I will continue on...
There is no feeling inside I can call my own
I will...
I will continue on...
I will...
I will...
This light inside of me just doesn't belong
Eemotions shouldn't exist at all
A simple spell is all that I am, you see
Should not procrastinate and you are master to me
I am just a memory of your imagination
I am just a memory of something that should make you run
And you can try to defy it
But I'm an evil spirit
You can't save me
I am just a memory
I will continue on...
I will...
I will continue on...
I will...
I will...
