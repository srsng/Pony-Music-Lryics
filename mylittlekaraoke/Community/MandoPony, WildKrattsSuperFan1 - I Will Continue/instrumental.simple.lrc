[00:26.52]There is no feeling inside I can call my-y own
[00:32.93]I-I cannot reap the seeds that I've never spoke
[00:39.23]Even if it fee-els like this body is real
[00:45.46]I've got to face the truth and fulfill my destiny-y-y-y-y
[00:52.06]I am just a memory of a life I've ne-ever lived
[00:58.43]I am just a memory of the gifts I cannot give
[01:04.39]And even if I wa-anted to
[01:07.96]I could never be like yo-ou
[01:11.33]There is nothing to-o be
[01:14.33]I am just a memory
[01:20.03]I-I-I will continu-ue o-on...
[01:26.41]There is no feeling inside I can call my-y own
[01:33.57]I-I-I will...
[01:38.59]I-I wi-ill continu-ue on...
[01:46.06]I-I-I will...
[01:51.42]I-I wi-i-i-ill...
[01:59.18]This light inside of me just doesn't belong
[02:05.67]E-emotions sho-ouldn't exist at all
[02:11.82]A simple spe-ell i-is all that I a-am, you see
[02:18.19]Should not procrastinate and you are master to me
[02:24.80]I am just a memory of your imagina-ation
[02:31.17]I am just a memory of something that should make yo-ou run
[02:37.02]And you can try to defy it
[02:40.32]But I'm an evil spi-irit
[02:43.47]You can't save me-e-e-e
[02:47.22]I am just a memory
[02:52.84]I-I-I will continu-ue o-o-on...
[03:06.23]I-I-I will...
[03:11.37]I-I wi-ill continu-ue on...
[03:18.83]I-I-I will...
[03:24.20]I-I wi-i-i-ill...
