[00:23.44]Farewell
[00:25.06]To this lucid life of mine
[00:27.57]I'll leave it all be-e-hind
[00:31.26]If you tell me that I'm needed
[00:33.73]And I'll try
[00:35.25]To finally fall asleep
[00:37.68]So tired of counting sheep
[00:41.45]Just tell me that I'm needed
[00:44.01]This light
[00:45.53]Seeps into my eyes
[00:47.73]And shows me many wonders a-and worlds beyond the sta-ars
[00:53.80]This light
[00:55.32]This glowing light you cast
[00:57.93]It tells me to come back to the-e world I've left behind
[01:03.85]So I'll lie down and think of you
[01:06.73]With the world at your feet
[01:08.93]As you start to rise in the east
[01:13.64]Now you're singin
[01:14.63]Hush now, quiet now
[01:16.83]As I drift to sleep
[01:19.34]I'll see you i-in my dreams
[01:23.79]Hopefully
[01:44.44]These stars
[01:45.92]Suspended in the sky
[01:48.39]I'll watch them shine to-onight
[01:52.21]Don't tell me that I'm dreaming
[01:54.59]And I'll wake
[01:55.98]To the brightness of the day
[01:58.45]As my dreams fade a-away
[02:01.68]I swear that I can hear her singing
[02:04.83]This song
[02:06.08]That's stuck inside my head
[02:08.87]Echoing through all of the thoughts around my mi-ind
[02:14.57]This song
[02:16.23]That I'm about to write
[02:18.70]I hope that I ca-an sing it to you tonight
[02:24.72]So I'll lie down and think of you
[02:27.55]With the world at your feet
[02:29.79]As you start to rise in the east
[02:34.46]Now you're singin
[02:35.45]Hush now, quiet now
[02:37.69]As I drift to sleep
[02:40.16]I'll see you i-in my dreams
[02:44.61]Hopefully
[03:05.44]Your voice
[03:06.97]Gliding through the ni-ight
[03:09.21]It sweetly sings to me as I start to close my e-e-e-eyes
[03:15.50]Your voice
[03:16.85]When I hear it tonight
[03:19.32]I know that everything will be a-alright
[03:25.33]So I'll lie down and think of you
[03:28.21]With the world at your feet
[03:30.36]As you start to rise in the east
[03:35.07]Now you're singin
[03:36.06]Hush now, quiet now
[03:38.31]As I drift to sleep
[03:40.78]I'll see you i-in my dreams
[03:45.31]Hopefully
