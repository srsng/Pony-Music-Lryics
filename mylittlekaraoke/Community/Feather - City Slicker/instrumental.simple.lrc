[00:48.00]See the shapes~ and colours~
[00:54.31]Of the patterns all around
[00:56.56]I'm lifted, soft like dawn
[01:04.00]Know the waves~ of light~~
[01:10.25]Tiny fragments of self
[01:12.50]They shifted, paint the town
[01:20.81]I don't got a care in the world
[01:26.75]City slicker
[01:28.69]Rain drops, they bounce right off my back
[01:36.75]I don't have to be that kind of girl
[01:42.75]City slicker
[01:44.75]Rain drops, they bounce right off my back
[01:52.00]See the sparks~ and shadows~~
[01:58.31]They reach o~ver shine
[02:00.50]I'm crossed in grids and lines
[02:08.00]Know the ne~gative spaces~~
[02:14.19]That you move~ within
[02:16.56]I'm dancing, in between
[02:24.75]Slow~ motion as I~ pause
[02:32.50]I see the beau~ty and the flaws
[02:40.81]Rain drops like~ dia~monds~
[02:48.31]I don't got a care in the world
[02:54.25]City slicker
[02:56.25]Rain drops, they bounce right off my back
[03:04.38]I don't have to be that kind of girl
[03:10.25]City slicker
[03:12.25]Rain drops, they bounce right off my back
[03:20.31]I don't got a care in the world
[03:26.25]City slicker
[03:28.31]Rain drops, they bounce right off my back
[03:34.31](they bounce right off my)
[03:36.25]I don't have to be that kind of girl
