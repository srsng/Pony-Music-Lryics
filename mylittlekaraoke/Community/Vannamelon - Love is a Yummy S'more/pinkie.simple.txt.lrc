Okay, wait wait wait
So you had how many brothers?
*gasp*!
That's horrible!
And sisters
I used to throw tons of parties for my sister Maud when we were little
But then, one day she just shut me out
And I never knew why
Okay, can I just, say something crazy?
All my life I've thrown a party nopony understood
And then suddenly I bump into you
But with youâ€¦
I see your face
And it's sweeter than a chocolate cake galore
Love is a yummy s'more!
Love is a yummy s'more!
Love is a yummy s'more
With you!
With you!
Love is a yummy s'more
What?!
Cinnamon buns?!
I would had never known you party just like me
Jinx! Jinx! Jinx!
Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation
And I
Just meant to be!
Say goodbye
To the pain of the past
We don't have to feel it anymore
Love is a yummy s'more~!
Love is a yummy s'more~!
Life can be so much more
With Cheese!
No you!
Love is a yummy s'more~~~
Can I say something even crazier?
Yes!
