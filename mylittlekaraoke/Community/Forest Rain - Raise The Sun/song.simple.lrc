[00:31.61]From the snow-swept mountain tops
[00:35.89]To the emerald green fields
[00:39.91]Across the sea and sky, that wondrous light
[00:44.73]Has touched us all
[00:48.62]And as the night begins to fade
[00:53.10]And the moon hangs low
[00:57.12]We wake to see the rise of her
[01:01.88]Celestial glow
[01:05.49]Woah
[01:08.57]Raise the sun
[01:13.93]Woah
[01:17.21]Raise the sun
[01:23.04]Every pony and parasprite
[01:27.32]Every dragon and bird
[01:31.61]Knows that without her light, her loving warmth
[01:36.29]We'd ne ver live
[01:39.91]Those cowards hide in shadows
[01:44.46]Sheathed by the night
[01:49.08]We fight the darkness, our swords
[01:53.04]Raised for the light
[01:56.85]Woah
[02:00.00]Raise the sun
[02:05.36]Woah
[02:08.57]Raise the sun
[02:14.33]Through out all of Equestria
[02:18.62]The Solar Empire endures
[02:22.97]Every colt and mare, we stand at arms
[02:27.72]Ten million strong
[02:31.34]You best stray from evil
[02:35.62]And stay in the light
[02:40.04]Or be lost to darkness like tears
[02:44.87]Shed in the night
[02:48.28]Woah
[02:51.43]Raise the sun
[02:56.85]Woah
[02:59.93]Raise the sun
[03:17.88]We shall never surrender
[03:20.69]We shall never let the darkness impede
[03:24.11]We shall stand strong for all eternity
[03:27.25]And spread her radiance and love
[03:32.81]MOVE OUT!
