[00:25.71]I'm feeling like a photograph
[00:27.88]Life never changes but it goes by fast and
[00:31.75]Far too fast for me to catch
[00:37.01]They tell me I'm too insecure
[00:39.17]That I should believe in myself more
[00:41.96]If only it was as easy as that
[00:48.31]Sometimes I just feel like
[00:51.17]A stranger in my life and
[00:53.99]Sometimes I don't feel right at all
[00:59.60]I may be lonely
[01:02.54]But maybe I'm supposed to be 'cuz
[01:05.60]No one's there to hear me when I call
[01:10.59]Things get complicated
[01:13.38]So I've watched and waited
[01:16.24]For the moment I'll find
[01:19.03]Someone like me
[01:21.50]I feel so underrated
[01:24.68]Some just leave me frustrated
[01:27.54]Feels like I'll never find
[01:30.33]Someone like me~
[01:55.63]My wings feel broken but they work fine
[01:58.11]I guess confidence never was mine
[02:01.97]A harsh word can leave me stunned
[02:07.08]Some say I'm unique and others strange
[02:09.56]Some say I'm just living up to my name
[02:12.42]But I can't be the only one
[02:18.65]Sometimes I just feel like
[02:20.86]A stranger in my life
[02:24.42]Sometimes I don't feel right at all
[02:29.99]I may be lonely
[02:33.01]But maybe I'm supposed to be 'cuz
[02:36.02]No one's there to hear me when I call
[02:40.90]Things get complicated
[02:43.76]So I've watched and waited
[02:46.63]For the moment I'll find
[02:49.41]Someone like me
[02:51.89]I feel so underrated
[02:55.06]Some just leave me frustrated
[02:57.85]Feels like I'll never find
[03:00.71]Someone like me
[03:04.58]Just when I thought I was all alone
[03:10.23]You came and showed me I'm not on my own
[03:15.88]I'm not that different, you've made me see
[03:21.53]I've finally found someone like me
[03:28.88]Things get complicated
[03:31.74]So I've watched and waited
[03:34.53]For the moment I'll find
[03:37.43]Someone like me
[03:39.94]I feel so underrated
[03:43.04]Some just leave me frustrated
[03:45.90]Maybe I've finally found
[03:48.69]Someone like me
[03:51.47]Things get complicated
[03:54.34]So I've watched and waited
[03:57.20]For the moment I'll find
[03:59.98]Someone like me
[04:02.54]I feel so underrated
