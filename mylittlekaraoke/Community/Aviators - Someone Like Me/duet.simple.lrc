[00:25.61][P1] I'm feeling like a photograph
[00:27.77][P1] Life never changes but it goes by fast and
[00:31.64][P1] Far too fast for me to catch
[00:36.90][P1] They tell me I'm too insecure
[00:39.07][P1] That I should believe in myself more
[00:41.86][P1] If only it was as easy as that
[00:48.20][P1] Sometimes I just feel like
[00:51.06][P1] A stranger in my life and
[00:53.85][P1] Sometimes I don't feel right at all
[00:59.50][P1] I may be lonely
[01:02.44][P1] But maybe I'm supposed to be 'cuz
[01:05.53][P1] No one's there to hear me when I call
[01:10.49][P1] Things get complicated
[01:13.27][P1] So I've watched and waited
[01:16.14][P1] For the moment I'll find
[01:18.92][P1] Someone like me
[01:21.40][P1] I feel so underrated
[01:24.57][P1] Some just leave me frustrated
[01:27.43][P1] Feels like I'll never find
[01:30.22][P1] Someone like me
[01:55.52][P2] My wings feel broken but they work fine
[01:58.00][P2] I guess confidence never was mine
[02:01.87][P2] A harsh word can leave me stunned
[02:06.98][P2] Some say I'm unique and others strange
[02:09.45][P2] Some say I'm just living up to my name
[02:12.32][P2] But I can't be the only one
[02:18.58][P2] Sometimes I just feel like
[02:20.75][P2] A stranger in my life
[02:24.31][P2] Sometimes I don't feel right at all
[02:29.88][P2] I may be lonely
[02:32.90][P2] But maybe I'm supposed to be 'cuz
[02:35.92][P2] No one's there to hear me when I call
[02:40.79][P2] Things get complicated
[02:43.66][P2] So I've watched and waited
[02:46.52][P2] For the moment I'll find
[02:49.31][P2] Someone like me
[02:51.78][P2] I feel so underrated
[02:54.95][P2] Some just leave me frustrated
[02:57.74][P2] Feels like I'll never find
[03:00.60][P2] Someone like me
[03:04.47][P1] Just when I thought I was all alone
[03:10.12][P2] You came and showed me I'm not on my own
[03:15.77][P1] I'm not that different, you've made me see
[03:21.42][P1] I've finally found someone like me
[03:21.42][P2] I've finally found someone like me
[03:28.77][P2] Things get complicated
[03:31.63][P2] So I've watched and waited
[03:34.42][P2] For the moment I'll find
[03:37.28][P2] Someone like me
[03:39.84][P2] I feel so underrated
[03:42.93][P2] Some just leave me frustrated
[03:45.80][P2] Maybe I've finally found
[03:48.58][P2] Someone like me
