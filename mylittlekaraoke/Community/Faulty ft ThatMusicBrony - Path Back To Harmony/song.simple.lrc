[00:04.77]Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh~ woah woah
[00:12.19]I'm looking for~, looking for~
[00:20.08]Hope feels lost~ when I look in your eyes
[00:27.54]Pave~ our way, we'll pave our way
[01:16.25]Fighting free~ from this labyrinth
[01:23.32]These endless paths~~ and twisting corners
[01:30.78]I know~ that we~ can find a way to get back home
[01:37.38]But it feels like we got lost along~ the way
[01:45.78]A familiar face~ but a different mind
[01:53.28]I'm looking for~ the person you left behind
[02:00.82]Your hope feels lost~ when I look in your eyes
[02:08.32]But we'll pave our way to bright~er skies
[02:23.75]Careless thoughts~ crawl back in my mind
[02:30.78]As our faces start to fade to~ gray
[02:38.52]The spark of magic's gone as friendship starts to die
[02:44.84]And it seems like we've forgotten who we are
[02:53.28]A familiar face~ but a different mind
[02:57.42](oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh~ woah woah)
[03:00.78]I'm looking for~ the person you left behind
[03:04.65](Looking for~, looking for~)
[03:08.28]Your hope feels lost~ when I look in your~ eyes
[03:12.66](hope feels lost~ when I look in your eyes)
[03:15.82]But we'll pave our way to bright~er skies
[03:20.00](pave our way~, we'll pave our way)
[03:38.79]Fight ing free~ from this labyrinth
[03:45.82]These endless paths~ and twisting corners
[03:53.32]I know~ that we~ can find a way~ to get back~ home
[03:59.92]But it feels like we got lost along~ the way
