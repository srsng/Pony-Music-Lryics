[00:13.07]Blink only once
[00:17.15]Then it's all over
[00:25.07]When the words have bite
[00:29.95]Don't give in
[00:37.07]I'll put up a fight
[00:40.87]They mustn't see me cry
[00:45.74]I have to
[00:47.95]Keep it inside
[00:52.40]Through my eyes you will see
[00:58.35]What I hide from sight
[01:04.03]All my hate and
[01:05.95]Bitterness
[01:11.15]I'm scared
[01:14.53]That they'll see
[01:16.40]My weak side
[01:19.40]God forbid
[01:22.35]But I swear
[01:25.40]I won't be defeated

[01:43.40]Let me in
[01:50.53]Bask in spiteful thoughts
[01:54.65]Blame every~one else
[02:00.65]Am I too far~ gone?

[02:13.40]Doubt~ is all I~ feel
[02:19.40]No one can know
[02:25.40]Keep it inside
[02:29.90]Through my eyes you will see
[02:35.90]What I hide from sight
[02:41.53]All my hate and
[02:43.45]Bitter~ness
[02:48.65]I'm scared
[02:51.98]That they'll see
[02:53.85]My weak side
[02:56.90]God forbid
[02:59.90]But I swear
[03:02.95]I won't be defeated
