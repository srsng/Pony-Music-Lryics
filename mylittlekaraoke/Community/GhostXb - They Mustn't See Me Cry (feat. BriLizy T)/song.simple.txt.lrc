Blink only once
Then it's all over
When the words have bite
Don't give in
I'll put up a fight
They mustn't see me cry
I have to
Keep it inside
Through my eyes you will see
What I hide from sight
All my hate and
Bitterness
I'm scared
That they'll see
My weak side
God forbid
But I swear
I won't be defeated
I must shut her out
Let me in
Bask in spiteful thoughts
Blame every~one else
Am I too far~ gone?
Am I a de~mon?
Doubt~ is all I~ feel
No one can know
Keep it inside
Through my eyes you will see
What I hide from sight
All my hate and
Bitter~ness
I'm scared
That they'll see
My weak side
God forbid
But I swear
I won't be defeated
