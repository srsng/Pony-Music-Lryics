You know I really wanna go with you
And that you really wanna make me choose
If I should live~ out the life you please
But I just feel~ it's just make be~lieve~~~~
I believe I'm fal~ling~
Falling in the sky
Yes I'm fal~ling~
Falling in the sky~
But why d'you wanna be with me
You make me cha~otic can't you see
Please don't be so~ sweet and kind to me
I just want some peace of mind~~~~
I believe I'm fal~ling~
Falling in the sky~
Yes I'm fal~ling~
Falling in the sky~
I believe I'm fal~ling~
Falling in the sky~
Yeah I'm fal~ling~
Falling in the sky
But why d'you wanna be with me
You make me cha~otic can't you see
Please don't be so sweet and kind to me
I just want some peace of mind~~~
I believe I'm fal~ling~
Falling in the sky~
Yes I'm fal~ling~
Falling in the sky
I believe I'm fal~ling~
Falling in the sky~
Yes I'm fal~ling~
Falling in the sky~
I believe I'm fal~ling~
Yeah I'm fal~ling~
