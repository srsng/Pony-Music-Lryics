[00:00.73]So here we are
[00:02.61]The last goodbye
[00:04.05]If only I could find some perfect phrase
[00:08.27]To make you laugh
[00:10.15]To make you cry
[00:11.52]To bring you joy~ before I fade~ away
[00:15.77]But in the end
[00:17.65]We're just pretend
[00:19.05]Some fleeting thoughts~ before the dark~ of sleep
[00:23.08]But I can feel
[00:25.19]So I am real
[00:26.55]So let's escape~ before we're~ in~ too deep
[00:30.46]So take~~~ me back to where it all began
[00:36.32]And if you wait~~~
[00:39.99]Then you will hear it all again
[00:43.78]The innocence in my heart
[00:47.61]When I had all my life ahead
[00:51.36]But every song that we start
[00:55.07]It has to end~
[01:15.03]Woah oh oh wow oh
[01:16.87]Woah oh oh wow oh
[01:18.74]Woah oh oh
[01:19.76]Raise your hands just one more time~
[01:22.53]Woah oh oh wow oh
[01:24.44]Oh oh oh wow oh wow
[01:26.98]I'll see you in some other life
[01:29.99]Woah oh oh wow oh
[01:31.91]Woah oh oh wow oh woah
[01:34.48]The atmosphere is raining light
[01:37.53]Woah oh oh wow oh
[01:39.37]Oh oh oh wow oh woah
[01:42.02]I'll see you in some other life
[02:15.73]We're setting sail
[02:17.65]Across the sky
[02:19.05]The constella~tions they will be~ our guide
[02:23.23]And suddenly
[02:25.11]Our promises
[02:26.52]Are just a me~lody that slipped our mind
[02:30.73]But maybe we
[02:32.61]Will meet again
[02:34.02]When all the stars~ align a path someday
[02:38.23]But as we are
[02:40.11]The scattered stars
[02:41.59]Are spreading us~ across the Milky Way
[02:45.30]Life's a par~ty pounding in a heartbeat
[02:49.25]That's all I know
[02:51.28]But if you listen real close
[02:54.25]Every beat will heal~ those
[02:56.75]Scars on your soul
[02:58.70]'Cause oh
[03:00.30]Life it hurts but in the end it's worth it
[03:04.21]Joy through the tears
[03:06.12]The years they say goodbye
[03:08.86]With memories that try~ to
[03:11.71]End all your fears
[03:13.66]End all your fears~
[03:30.03]Woah oh oh wow oh
[03:31.91]Woah oh oh wow oh
[03:33.78]Woah oh oh
