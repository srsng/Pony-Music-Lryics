[01:22.08][P1] So there you are, my dad
[01:25.28][P1] A statue oh so cold, so dead

[02:10.03][P2] Your daddy is still very here
[02:13.63][P2] And when I do bust out
[02:16.47][P2] We can respread the random fear
[02:19.81][P2] Our joy will be their pain

[03:01.28][P2] And things were never quite the same
[03:04.47][P1] My wild~ pitches flew driving the ponies all insane
