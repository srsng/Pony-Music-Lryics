My Little Pony
Friendship is Magic
Come on and let's meet
Our pony friends
There's Twilight Sparkle
An alicorn pony
To books and to lessons
This pony tends
Friendship is Magic
In the town of Ponyville
That's right, sing it!
Helping learning
And gettin' along
For the Mane Six
This magic isn't just tricks
Hearts and hooves
These ponies are strong
Fluttershy takes care
Of all the sweet creatures
That pony is timid
Yet she is brave
Rainbow Dash races
With pegasus passion
Too bad that pony
Just won't behave
Friendship is Magic
In the town of Ponyville
Helping learning
And getting along
For the Mane Six
This magic isn't just tricks
Hearts and hooves
These ponies are strong
Applejack works hard
Just like all Earth ponies
Putting the pony
Before the cart
And Rarity's beauty
Finds all the great treasures
Making them sparkle
And shine like her heart
Friendship is Magic
In the town of Ponyville
Helping learning
And getting along
For the Mane Six
This magic isn't just tricks
Hearts and hooves
These ponies are strong
Pinkie Pie's laughter
Is what makes her special
Her smile shine bright
Just like the sun
Together these six friends
Are so elemental
For harmony binds them
And can't be undone
Friendship is Magic
In the town of Ponyville
Helping learning
And getting along
For the Mane Six
This magic isn't just tricks
Hearts and hooves
These ponies are strong
For the Mane Six
This magic isn't just tricks
Hearts and hooves
These ponies are strong
