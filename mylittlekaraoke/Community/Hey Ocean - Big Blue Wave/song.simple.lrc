[00:09.69]All we do is mess aroud
[00:14.78]But I know that it's love we found
[00:20.20]I know that it's here to stay
[00:25.18]It's more than just a word we say
[00:30.49]No I don't wanna fuss or fight
[00:35.75]And I'm not one to give advice
[00:41.00]But there's no need to be afraid
[00:46.42]Baby there's no time to waste
[00:52.55]Sing until you have no voice
[00:57.70]Sing because you have no choice
[01:03.06]Sing until you float away
[01:08.10]Our love is like a big blue wave
[01:16.53]It's like a big blue wave
[01:23.87]Don't tell me that we've come this far
[01:29.18]To start again or fall apart
[01:34.65]Sing it when you're lost at sea
[01:39.63]And love will bring you back to me~~
[01:45.82]Sing until you have no voice
[01:51.29]Sing because you have no choice
[01:56.50]Sing until you float away
[02:01.59]Our love is like a big blue wave
[02:09.58]Sing until you have no voice
[02:14.83]Sing because you have no choice
[02:20.09]Sing until you float away~
[02:25.40]Sing until you're home again~~
[02:42.04]Sing until you have no voice
[02:47.35]Sing because you have no choice
[02:52.55]Sing until you float away
[02:57.65]Our love is like a big blue wave
[03:08.59]It's like a big blue wave
