[00:26.37]Three friends
[00:27.36]Taking on the world together
[00:29.34]Big plans in a bigger world
[00:32.31]Still kids afraid of being young forever
[00:35.28]Young eyes watch life unfurl~
[00:38.40]Why do you sit there sighing
[00:40.80]Instead of trying one more time?
[00:44.15]I've been there
[00:45.23]I know exactly what you're thinking
[00:47.17]But why try growing up too fast~?
[00:50.14]Now, I've learned it's better living in the moment
[00:53.11]Enjoy youth, cause it doesn't last
[00:55.52]Now you're hoping, trying, praying, crying
[00:58.68]For your destiny to come this time
[01:02.22]You are so young
[01:03.87]And you are so free
[01:05.23]But you're aimless
[01:06.32]And I can't help but see
[01:08.40]That you don't know
[01:09.81]What you really need
[01:11.37]"Are we there yet
[01:12.83]Are we there yet?"
[01:14.20]You've done it all
[01:15.85]From A to Z
[01:17.17]Are you trying
[01:18.30]To find your destiny?
[01:20.38]One day you'll know
[01:21.89]Who you wanna be
[01:23.40]"Are we there yet?
[01:24.90]Are we there yet?"
[01:26.41]Young eyes see everything you've ever wanted
[01:29.43]Hope dies when it won't come true~
[01:32.17]But realize the possibilities are endless
[01:35.19]And in time it will be all for you
[01:37.55]And you're hoping, trying, praying, crying
[01:40.75]But your destiny will come in time
[01:44.20]You are so young
[01:45.85]And you are so free
[01:47.17]But you're aimless
[01:48.30]And I can't help but see
[01:50.38]That you don't know
[01:51.74]What you really need
[01:53.30]"Are we there yet
[01:54.48]A- A- Are we there yet?"
[01:56.32]You've done it all
[01:57.83]From A to Z
[01:59.34]Are you trying
[02:00.23]To find your destiny?
[02:02.31]Still you don't know
[02:03.77]Who you wanna be?
[02:05.33]"Are we there yet?
[02:06.46]A- A- Are we there yet?"
[02:35.23]You are so young
[02:36.84]And you are so free
[02:38.21]But you're aimless
[02:39.34]And I can't help but see
[02:41.37]That you don't know
[02:42.88]What you really need
[02:44.39]"Are we there yet,
[02:45.57]A- A- Are we there yet?"
[02:47.36]You've done it all
[02:48.82]From A to Z
[02:50.38]Are you trying
[02:51.37]To find your destiny?
[02:53.30]Still you don't know
[02:54.86]Who you wanna be~?
[02:56.41]"Are we there yet?
[02:57.55]A- A- Are we there yet?"
