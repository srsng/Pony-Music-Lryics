[00:57.00]Hey there big sister
[01:01.01]I've got a question
[01:05.03]Why do they love you
[01:09.08]Why do they scorn my beauty
[01:21.35]Moon's in the sky now
[01:25.33]Not long 'till sunrise
[01:29.45]You say to drop it
[01:33.47]I don't see why I have to
[01:37.63]And I feel~ so alive~
[01:45.14]As I take~ to the skies~
[01:52.64]And I shout~ my decry~
[02:00.18]Look up now~ say goodbye~
[02:05.77]You won't see it rise tomorrow
[02:43.03]Hey there big sister
[02:47.08]Why the long face?~
[02:51.06]Are you just jealous
[02:55.15]Jealous that they adore me?
[02:59.35]No point in fighting
[03:03.33]I'm in control now
[03:07.08]Celestia darling
[03:11.47]This is my new republic
[03:15.63]And I feel~ so alive~
[03:23.10]As I take~ to the skies~
[03:30.60]And I shout~ my decry~
[03:38.14]Look up now~ say goodbye~
[03:43.77]You won't see it rise tomorrow
[03:56.30]The price of freedom
[04:01.97]Tonight we end the tyranny of our solar queen
[05:02.11]Lower the moon they cry as they fall from the skies
[05:06.76]Fear on their treacherous sunloving faces
[05:10.51]A small price to pay for they all now bow to me
[06:01.95]Come at me if you dare strike down the ones you love
[06:06.98]But you won't ever douse the fire that burns inside of me
[06:11.97]Torture me all you want lock me up in a cell
[06:16.32]You bully me with your friends but never will I lower the moon
[06:41.27]And I feel so alive
[06:48.74]As I take to the skies
[06:57.22]The moon~ takes me in her cold~ embrace
[07:05.13]No regrets for what I've done
[07:25.06]The night shall last forever
