[01:13.49]These year stricken pa-ages
[01:20.11]Are an old memory
[01:26.48]And I've been here fo-or a-ages
[01:33.27]And always will be
[01:39.84]We'll never retu-u-u-urn to
[01:46.47]The world the wa-ay it was
[01:52.94]I'll never return to my friends up above
[02:18.88]Through this life of adventures
[02:25.82]Short lived fairytales
[02:32.34]I've seen your de-epa-a-a-arture
[02:38.92]But your faces rema-ain
[02:45.54]Inside of my he-e-e-e-ad
[02:52.12]'Til it's all said and done
[02:58.74]You never betra-ayed me, my friends up above
[03:37.43]The-ere's so many diff'rent e-e-eyes
[03:44.77]They wander to and fro
[03:51.40]But how can I be fi-i-ine
[03:57.87]If none of them are yours
[04:36.96]Now it's time to depart and
[04:44.05]We say our goodbye-es
[04:50.58]We've all come so fa-ar
[04:57.05]Everyone has their ti-ime
[05:03.52]But I'll see you in the stars tonight
[05:10.25]Look at what it's become
[05:16.72]I should not have doubted my friends up above
