These year stricken pages
Are an old memory
And I've been here for ages
And always will be
We'll never return to
The world the way it was
I'll never return to my friends up above
Through this life of adventures
Short lived fairytales
I've seen your departure
But your faces remain
Inside of my head
'Til it's all said and done
You never betrayed me, my friends up above
There's so many diff'rent eyes
They wander to and fro
But how can I be fine
If none of them are yours
Now it's time to depart and
We say our goodbyes
We've all come so far
Everyone has their time
But I'll see you in the stars tonight
Look at what it's become
I should not have doubted my friends up above
