Ah~~~~~
I've kicked dragons in the face
I've won death in the race
I clear skies in ten seconds flat
I bet you can't beat that
I fly faster than the sound
I'll beat my foes to the ground
I'm the strongest thing around
I'd kick the shit out of hell hound
Like a flaming arrow
Flying over castle walls
Burning down my enemies~
Leading my friends to victo~ry
I'm faster than a lightning
Soaring through the sky
Louder than the thunder
Roaring in the night~
Stronger than a hurricane
In all its might
Prouder than a lion
I'm ready to fight
Faster
Louder
Stronger
Prouder
Oh!
I'm a savior from the skies
Hero with no disguise
Brighter than the thousands suns
I'll be there with blazing guns
I am your turbolover
It takes days to recover
Being cool is my destiny
Kneel before my supremacy
Like armor piercing bullet
Going through the six inch~ steel
Destroying my enemies' guard
Leading my friends to victo~ry
I'm faster than a lightning
Soaring through the sky
Louder than the thunder
Roaring in the night~
Stronger than a hurricane
In all its might
Prouder than a lion
I'm ready to fight
Ah ah~ ah
Faster than a lightning
Soaring through the sky
Louder than the thunder
Roaring in the night
Stronger than a hurricane
In all its might
Prouder than a lion
She's ready to fight
I'm faster than a lightning
Soaring through the sky
Louder than the thunder
Roaring in the night~
Stronger than a hurricane
In all its might
Prouder than a lion
I'm ready to fight
Soaring in the sky
Roaring in the night
In all its might
I'm ready to fight
Ah ah
Ah ah
Ah oh
Ah ah
Come on!
