[00:15.18]I still can remember the tear in her eye
[00:18.07]When she cast her spell and said nothing more than "goodby-y-ye"
[00:24.48]The faces fade as the memories age
[00:27.61]A lifetime lost and a chi-ildhood thrown awa-a-ay
[00:33.98]Best of luck to the world out there and I hope yo-ou'll be o-okay
[00:40.19]Meanwhi-ile, I'm feeling right at home
[00:44.42]With what I got around me
[00:46.37]Seems li-ike I would be all alone
[00:50.64]If no one ever found me
[00:53.11]If you come looking around for me, leave me be-e
[00:58.33]'Cause the only friends I've got are all I-I need

[01:26.48]The mother bear goes where the little cub knows to fo-ollow

[01:57.19]'Cause the only friends I've got are all I-I need
[02:56.48]Meanwhi-ile, I'm feeling right at home
[03:00.66]With what I got around me

[03:06.88]If no one ever found me
[03:09.44]If you come looking around for me, leave me be-e
