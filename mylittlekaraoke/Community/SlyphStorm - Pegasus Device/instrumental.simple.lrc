[00:36.03]Deep in the pages of history
[00:38.28]Lies a shadow hiding in a mystery
[00:41.19]A late night story buried far away
[00:43.52]Until it once again sees the light of day
[00:46.19]And when the little colts and fillies turn out all the lights
[00:48.94]And tell the story of a factory as black as night
[00:51.81]The luxury of rainbows comes at a price
[00:54.15]So just ignore the screams, and don't think twice
[00:57.10]You've proven to yourself and to all of us
[00:59.52]That you're not fit to fly like a pegasus
[01:02.48]You don't even deserve those wings you bear
[01:04.98]When you stand beside a legend, you don't even compare
[01:07.98]All of the failures help to fuel success~
[01:10.39]In the bloody and visceral weather game of chess
[01:12.89]And just because you've disappointed you'll pay the price
[01:15.68]Now accept your fate and die in the pegasus device
[01:29.30]Phantom screams echo through the ruined facility
[01:31.85]A horrible silence builds an eerie tranquility
[01:34.51]The souls of many innocent fill~ the air
[01:37.01]And the hope that they all died with scattered here and there
[01:39.89]A mighty machine built within the wake
[01:42.34]Of a long dead dream, little demon awake
[01:45.18]The citizens sleep, never quite knowing when
[01:47.67]The device will reawaken, hungry again
[01:50.47]You've proven to yourself and to all of us
[01:52.84]That you're not fit to fly like a pegasus
[01:55.84]You don't even deserve those wings you bear
[01:58.34]When you stand beside a legend, you don't even compare
[02:01.38]All of the failures help to fuel success~
[02:03.71]In the bloody and visceral weather game of chess
[02:06.25]And just because you've disappointed you'll pay the price
[02:09.04]Now accept your fate and die in the pegasus device
[02:54.66]All of the failures help to fuel success~
[02:57.03]In the bloody and visceral weather game of chess
[02:59.53]And just because you've disappointed you'll pay~ the price
[03:02.32]Now accept your fate and die in the pegasus device
[03:16.03]I don't even remember my past
[03:18.65]I don't remember who I used to be
[03:21.15]I don't remember my friends of old
[03:23.78]I don't remember my destiny
[03:26.36]My mane is purple and my coat is orange
[03:29.11]What I've become? I have no~ idea~
[03:31.65]I only know one simple thing
[03:34.36]The name they gave me, Absentia~
[03:37.77] -yourself and to all of us
[03:39.52]That you're not fit to fly like a pegasus
[03:42.52]You don't even deserve those little wings you bear
[03:44.98]When you stand beside a legend, you don't even compare
[03:47.98]All of the failures help to fuel success
[03:50.35]In the bloody and visceral weather game of chess
[03:52.89]And just because you've disappointed you'll pay the price
[03:55.73]Now accept your fate and die in the pegasus device
[03:58.48]I don't even recognize your rainbow mane
[04:00.97]When you hide it behind that mask of shame
[04:03.81]You don't even deserve those wings you bear
[04:06.43]You used to be a legend, a righteous mare
[04:09.31]All of the failures help to fuel success
[04:11.68]In the bloody and visceral weather game of chess
[04:14.18]And then you sit upon your throne
[04:15.72] And you roll your diamond dice
[04:17.05]And you send us all to die in your pegasus device
[04:19.68]In the Rainbow Factory
[04:22.47] Where fears and horrors come true
[04:25.22]In the Rainbow Factory
[04:27.47] Where not a single soul gets through
[04:31.22]In the Rainbow Factory, where failures pay their toll
[04:38.80]Now I've awoken, and I'm taking back control
