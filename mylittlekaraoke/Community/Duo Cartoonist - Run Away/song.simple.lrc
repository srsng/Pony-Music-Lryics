[00:14.35]All in life has a price
[00:18.14]With talent comes strife
[00:20.84]To honor all those who believed in you
[00:25.19]Then, one day you'll look back
[00:29.02]See just what you la-ack
[00:31.72]Well, you could have
[00:33.40]If you had chose another path
[00:36.40]All the things they taught me, to help me gro-o-ow
[00:41.84]Now I'm asked to hold back and let it go
[00:47.32]Well, if I can't be myself
[00:49.34]That just means I don't belong
[00:52.75]You can count me out of this game
[00:54.85]I refuse to play along!
[01:05.99]I can't hold back this feeling
[01:09.59]I don't think I can stay
[01:12.93]This place no longer feels like home
[01:16.57]I wish to run away
[01:22.45]Run away
[01:29.73]Run away, run away
[01:33.37]Don't look back, it's oka-y
[01:36.63]Race the wind, be the first to find
[01:39.93]The light of a new day
[01:42.67]Run away, run away
[01:46.53]There's no reason left to sta-y
[01:49.83]I won't shed a single tear because
[01:53.17]My life begins today
[01:59.77]I obeyed every rule
[02:03.10]And I feel like a-a fool
[02:06.33]When I see where all that
[02:08.47] Compliance has gotten me
[02:12.93]Those I love, I wi-ill miss
[02:16.19]Please forgive me fo-or this
[02:19.53]But I know that you're strong
[02:22.08]And you don't ne-ed me here
[02:31.57]That one time I went on my-y own
[02:34.75]And I dared to cross the line
[02:37.90]I found out the courage within me
[02:41.24]And I learned to rise a-nd shine
[02:44.58]I've been dreaming of adventure
[02:47.84]Ever since that faithfu-ul day
[02:51.10]Live is forged by my own choices
[02:54.29]I don't care what they ma-y say
[03:00.52]So I'll say
[03:07.12]Run away, run away
[03:10.75]Don't look back, it's oka-y
[03:13.98]Race the wind, be the first to find
[03:17.28]The light of a new da-y
[03:20.13]Run away, run away
[03:23.77]There's no reason left to stay
[03:26.88]I won't shed a single tear
[03:29.50]Because my life
[03:33.18]Yes, my li-i-i-ife begins today
