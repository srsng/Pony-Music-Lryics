[00:09.54]I impale my head with a rose,
[00:12.96]The blood should go well
[00:14.57] With my-y hooficure
[00:17.29]I'm really sad I don't have friends
[00:19.57]I'll fill the void with mannequins
[00:22.04]Holy crap, I didn't know
[00:23.93]My eyes could glow
[00:26.75]A rupee from Legend of Ze-elda
[00:30.71]Now I will sit and
[00:31.96]Talk to my refle-ections
[00:35.29]Can't you see that I'm depressed
[00:37.32]Please Twilight, give it a rest
[00:39.68]Camera cuts while I strike
[00:41.25]A dramatic pose
[00:43.93]My rose was red, how'd it turn pink?
[00:46.07]Now I'm mad, so kick the apples
[00:48.54]Then, I teleport to the ri-ight
[00:52.14]Carress the mannequin
[00:53.82]Sing some more, I hate this hat
[00:56.11]So I wi-ill
[00:57.36]Laserbeam it dead
[01:00.36]Suddenly an opera
[01:03.46]This song gives me ve-ertigo
[01:07.43]Animation error
[01:10.07]With my eyes
[01:14.36]Ignore all the tunnels
[01:15.82]We will find some other way
[01:18.25]Stop, nevermind, just keep on running
[01:21.64]I will use my pony powers
[01:23.79]To dialate my eyes
[01:25.57]This place looks a lot like
[01:27.25]Gringotts bank
[01:29.43]I'm too weak to-o push the cart
[01:32.68]Why won't Twi-ilight help me-e now?
[01:36.82]We're going to die
[01:39.89]I should have thought this through
[01:52.82]Finally the moment
[01:54.21]Has  arrived
[01:56.14]To-o show
[01:57.32]Two clips at the same time
[02:00.54]I can leap real far
[02:01.75]That wall is super sparkly
[02:03.79]Sing a hi-igh note a-and then...
[02:06.68]Black, it's all black! Ga-ha-ha-ha*snort*
