I impale my head with a rose,
The blood should go well
With my hooficure
I'm really sad I don't have friends
I'll fill the void with mannequins
Holy crap, I didn't know
My eyes could glow
A rupee from Legend of Zelda
Now I will sit and
Talk to my reflections
Can't you see that I'm depressed
Please Twilight, give it a rest
Camera cuts while I strike
A dramatic pose
My rose was red, how'd it turn pink?
Now I'm mad, so kick the apples
Then, I teleport to the right
Carress the mannequin
Sing some more, I hate this hat
So I will
Laserbeam it dead
Suddenly an opera
This song gives me vertigo
Animation error
With my eyes
Ignore all the tunnels
We will find some other way
Stop, nevermind, just keep on running
I will use my pony powers
To dialate my eyes
This place looks a lot like
Gringotts bank
I'm too weak to push the cart
Why won't Twilight help me now?
We're going to die
I should have thought this through
Finally the moment
Has arrived
To show
Two clips at the same time
I can leap real far
That wall is super sparkly
Sing a high note and then...
Black, it's all black! Gahaha*snort*
