[00:00.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:02.25]Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:04.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:07.42]First, we thought that Babs
[00:08.75]Was so really, really sweet
[00:10.75]A new friend to have
[00:12.31]Then it seemed like such a treat
[00:14.69]But then, we found the truth;
[00:16.08]She's just a bully from the east
[00:18.25]She went from Babs, yeah,
[00:19.86]To a bully and a beast
[00:22.08]Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead
[00:25.20]Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do?
[00:28.31]Got a bully on our tail
[00:30.08]Gotta hide, we gotta bail
[00:32.25]Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you
[00:35.42]Gotta run, we gotta flee
[00:37.14]Gotta hurry, don't you see?
[00:39.81]Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad seed
[00:43.20]Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:44.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:46.75]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:50.03]Hidin' from a bully,
[00:51.59]We know it isn't right
[00:53.14]But the Cutie Mark Crusaders,
[00:54.98]We aren't lookin' for a fight
[00:57.37]Oh, she'll go home soon,
[00:58.70]And then we'll have some peace again
[01:01.20]But for now, we're staying out of her way 'til then
[01:04.70]Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead
[01:07.81]Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do?
[01:11.03]Got a bully on our tail
[01:12.76]Gotta hide, we gotta bail
[01:14.98]Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you
[01:18.09]Gotta run, we gotta flee
[01:19.87]Gotta hurry, don't you see?
[01:21.98]Why so mean? Why so crude?
[01:25.48]Why so angry? Why so rude?
[01:29.09]Can't you be nice? Can't we be friends?
[01:32.76]Isn't it sad is this how it all ends?
[01:36.31]Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad
[01:39.81]Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad
[01:43.37]Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad seed
