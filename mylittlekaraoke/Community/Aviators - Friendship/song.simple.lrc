[00:29.89]I believed what we had would last forever
[00:34.11]After all the moments we spent together
[00:37.91]Were they meaningless in the end~~?
[00:44.66]If friendship is supposed to be magic
[00:48.36]Then why has ours become so tragic
[00:52.11]I'm no longer proud to call you my~ friend
[00:59.43]Feels like after all this time
[01:02.95]You should have known we'd be here tonight
[01:06.88]Wondering where the past has gone
[01:10.11]All the memories we lost when we moved on
[01:14.26]Honestly, it hurts thinking
[01:17.84]About the way
[01:19.34]We were, just you and me
[01:21.70]This isn't what friendship's supposed to be~~
[01:43.80]Giving up always seemed so easy
[01:47.49]But it's hard when it's you and me
[01:51.41]And I don't wanna say goodbye
[01:58.57]We've hurt each other time and time again
[02:02.55]I guess all good things come to an end
[02:06.18]But I don't wanna lose you tonight~~
[02:13.28]Feels like after all this time
[02:16.80]You should have known we'd be here tonight
[02:20.72]Wondering where the past has gone
[02:23.90]All the memories we lost when we moved on
[02:28.11]Honestly, it hurts thinking
[02:31.63]About the way
[02:33.13]We were, just you and me
[02:35.55]This isn't what friendship's supposed to be~~
[02:58.11]Don't say goodbye
[03:04.51]I promise everything will be alright~~
[03:12.41]Don't leave me
[03:14.26]I'm sorry
[03:16.05]I'll fix this if it costs me my life
[03:20.09]I'm going to make this right
[03:58.51]Feels like after all this time
[04:02.03]You should have known we'd be here tonight
[04:06.01]Wondering where the past has gone
