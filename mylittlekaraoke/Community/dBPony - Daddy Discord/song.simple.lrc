[00:51.41]Because it's all a tragic plot~ to~ tear~ you~
[00:56.01]Anything for~ Dad~dy Dis~cord

[01:10.00]We'll wreak chaos through the night and day~
[01:13.22]Now, doesn't that sound fun~
[01:18.13]Turn your houses upside down~~
[01:20.50]Then turn your happy face into a frown
[01:24.28]Let your aspirations drown~~~
[01:28.71]Who cares~~ if chaos isn't fair~

[02:35.28]All alone I sit here by~ your side
[02:39.80]The living tomb~stone which on~ly I confide~
[02:46.04]If on~ly I~~~ could break you out~ alive
[02:50.99]We'd do~ this all~ again
[02:54.22]But until then
[03:00.16]Discord, I'm howling at the moon
[03:02.74]And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
[03:05.66]Discord, whatever will I do
[03:08.29]To make you reign your~ ty~ran~ny again
[03:35.06]Small communities grow great through harmony
[03:38.20]Great ones fall to pieces through discord...
