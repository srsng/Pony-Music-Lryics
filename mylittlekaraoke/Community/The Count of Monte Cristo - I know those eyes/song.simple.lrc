[00:01.06]My God, my heart beats faster
[00:04.76]And my mind is racing
[00:07.85]Could it be…?
[00:09.76]Could it be that you’ve come back to life?
[00:16.71]I know those eyes following me
[00:23.66]Dark and familiar and deep as the sea
[00:30.69]I know that face, strange though it seems
[00:37.64]Younger and kinder it haunts all my dreams
[00:44.63]How can you stand there?
[00:47.55]A whisper from me
[00:50.80]Yet, somehow be so far away
[00:57.55]In eyes once familiar a stranger I see
[01:04.25]With so many words left to say
[01:10.23]This man is dead
[01:12.06]He is no more
[01:13.64]He died a little each day
[01:17.75]Like a thief, the Château D’If has stolen him away
[01:23.76]The mind plays tricks
[01:25.43]You are confused
[01:27.01]The man you seek is long gone
[01:31.16]Dead and cold
[01:32.54]A story told
[01:34.12]By those he trusted
[01:36.11]Those he loved
[01:37.62]And those who then moved on
[01:53.22]I am a ghost, just a mirage
[01:56.63]Who chases traces of you
[02:00.98]Dark and familiar and deep as the sea
[02:06.96]This man is dead
[02:08.58]He is no more
[02:10.33]And though it’s torturing me
[02:14.31]Can either of us really ever be free?
[02:21.26]How can you stand there?
[02:24.31]A whisper from me
[02:27.56]When you are still so far away
[02:34.10]And why does the truth seem too hard to be true?
[02:41.25]With so much broken
[02:44.34]And so much damage
[02:47.63]There are no words
[02:50.44]Left to say
