[Threatening trumpet sounds]
We have learned of our misguided ways and wish to atone for our past misdeeds.
Allow us but a chance to showth thou that we have become humbled, just and kind.
Our soul hath been cleansed by the shining light of the moon and wishes for nothing
else then to walk the land once again under the fair golden light of our sister.
We, too, could become the best of companions and walk together, side by side.
I ask for thou to open thy heart and giveth mercy.
