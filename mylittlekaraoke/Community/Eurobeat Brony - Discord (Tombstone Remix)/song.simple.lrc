[00:09.38]I'm not a fan of puppeteers, but I've a nagging fear
[00:12.10]Someone else is pulling at the strings
[00:13.95]Something terrible is going down
[00:15.56]Through the entire town
[00:16.70]Wreaking anarchy and all it brings
[00:18.52]I can't sit i-idly, no-o, I can't move at all
[00:22.52]I curse the name
[00:23.81]The one behind it a-a-a-a-all
[00:27.38]Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
[00:29.52]And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
[00:31.95]Discord, whatever did we do
[00:34.10]To make you take our world away?
[00:36.52]Discord, are we your prey alone
[00:38.67]Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne
[00:41.10]Discord, we won't take it anymore
[00:43.27]So take your tyranny away!
[01:04.24]I'm fine with changing status quo, but not in letting go
[01:06.99]Now the world is being torn apart
[01:08.88]A terrible catastrophe
[01:10.38]Played by your symphony
[01:11.52]What a terrifying work of art
[01:13.38]I can't sit i-idly, no-o, I can't move at all
[01:17.38]I curse the name
[01:18.67]The one behind it a-a-a-a-all
[01:22.24]Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
[01:24.38]And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
[01:26.81]Discord, whatever did we do
[01:28.95]To make you take our world away?
[01:31.38]Discord, are we your prey alone
[01:33.52]Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne
[01:35.95]Discord, we won't take it anymore
[01:38.13]So take your tyranny away!
[02:53.67]Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
[02:55.81]And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
[02:58.24]Discord, whatever did we do
[03:00.38]To make you take our world away?
[03:02.81]Discord, are we your prey alone
[03:04.95]Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne
[03:07.38]Discord, we won't take it anymore
[03:09.56]So take your tyranny away!
