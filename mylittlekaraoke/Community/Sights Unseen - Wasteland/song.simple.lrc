[00:47.13]I had it all worked out
[00:50.06]Inside this twisted mind
[00:52.99]A little game to play
[00:55.19]A travel back i-in time
[00:58.85]To seek what I deserve
[01:01.78]Revenge that I can serve
[01:04.70]But now I messed up

[01:10.11]We are living in a wasteland
[01:14.50]Barren worlds of dust and
[01:17.43]Nowhere we can hide
[01:21.82]Sa-ated, my thirst has aba-ated

[02:41.64]In this wasteland of mine
[02:53.36]In this wasteland of mine
[03:54.41]I had my heart set on only one thing
[03:59.90]Bringing you down for what you broke
[04:05.40]But now I see I was messing wi-ith fate
[04:11.26]I finally understand there are things that I do-on't know
[04:17.39]We are living in a wasteland
[04:21.78]Barren worlds of dust and
