I had it all worked out
Inside this twisted mind
A little game to play
A travel back in time
To seek what I deserve
Revenge that I can serve
But now I messed up
From this path, I can't turn
We are living in a wasteland
Barren worlds of dust and
Nowhere we can hide
Sated, my thirst has abated
This world I've created
There's no hope to find
In this wasteland of mine
In this wasteland of mine
It was my final plan
Stop telling me your lies
It's not my fault
That you can't win, though you try
But now I'm losing too
There's nothing I can do
I sought revenge on you
But now I'm so confused
We are living in a wasteland
Barren worlds of dust and
Nowhere we can hide
Sated, my thirst has abated
This world I've created
There's no hope to find
In this wasteland of mine
In this wasteland of mine
I had my heart set on only one thing
Bringing you down for what you broke
But now I see I was messing with fate
I finally understand there are things that I don't know
We are living in a wasteland
Barren worlds of dust and
Nowhere we can hide
Sated, my thirst has abated
This world I've created
There's no hope to find
In this wasteland of
We are living in a wasteland
Barren worlds of dust and
Nowhere we can hide
Sated, my thirst has abated
This world I've created
There's no hope to find
In this wasteland of mine
In this wasteland of mine
In this wasteland of mine
