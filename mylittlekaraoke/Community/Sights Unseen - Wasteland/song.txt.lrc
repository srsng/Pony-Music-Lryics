I had it all worked out
Inside this twisted mind
A little game to play
A travel back i-in time
To seek what I deserve
Revenge that I can serve
But now I messed up
From this path, I ca-an't turn
We are living in a wasteland
Barren worlds of dust and
Nowhere we can hide
Sa-ated, my thirst has aba-ated
This world I've crea-ated
There's no hope to find
In this wasteland of mine
In this wasteland of mine
It was my final plan
Stop telling me your lies
It's not my fault
That you can't wi-in, tho-ough you try-y
But now I'm losing too
There's nothing I can do
I sought revenge on you
But now I'm so confu-used
We are living in a wasteland
Barren worlds of dust and
Nowhere we can hide
Sa-ated, my thirst has aba-ated
This world I've crea-ated
There's no hope to find
In this wasteland of mine
In this wasteland of mine
I had my heart set on only one thing
Bringing you down for what you broke
But now I see I was messing wi-ith fate
I finally understand there are things that I do-on't know
We are living in a wasteland
Barren worlds of dust and
Nowhere we can hide
Sa-ated, my thirst has aba-ated
This world I've crea-ated
There's no hope to find
In this wasteland of-
We are living in a wasteland
Barren worlds of dust and
Nowhere we can hide
Sa-ated, my thirst has aba-ated
This world I've crea-ated
There's no hope to find
In this wasteland of mine
In this wasteland of mine
In this wasteland of mine
