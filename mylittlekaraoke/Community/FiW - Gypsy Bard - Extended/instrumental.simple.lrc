[00:17.53]When you're rife with devastation
[00:19.58]There's a simple explanation
[00:21.58]You're a toymaker's creation
[00:23.52]Trapped inside a crystal ball
[00:25.64]Now whichever way he tilts it
[00:27.57]Know that we must be resilient
[00:29.57]We won't let them break our spirits
[00:31.56]As we sing our silly song
[00:34.25]When I was a little filly
[00:35.93]A galloping blaze overtook my city
[00:37.86]They shipped me off to the orphanage
[00:39.80]Said, "ditch those roots if you wanna fit in"
[00:41.92]So I dug one thousand holes
[00:43.92]And cut a rug with orphan foals
[00:45.91]Now, memories are blurred, and the faces are obscured
[00:47.85]But I still know the words of this song
[00:49.53]When you've bungled all your bangles
[00:51.59]And your loved ones have been mangled
[00:53.52]Listen to the jingle jangle
[00:55.58]Of my gypsy tambourine
[00:57.58]'Cause these chords are hypnotizing
[00:59.58]And the whole world's harmonizing
[01:01.57]So please children stop your crying
[01:03.63]And just sing along with me
[01:30.27]When I was a little filly
[01:31.89]A galloping blaze overtook my city
[01:33.89]They shipped me off to the orphanage.
[01:35.82]Said, "ditch those roots if you wanna fit in"
[01:38.01]So I dug one thousand holes
[01:39.94]And cut a rug with orphan foals
[01:41.87]Now, memories are blurred, and their faces are obscured
[01:43.81]But I still know the words of this song
[01:45.56]When you've bungled all your bangles
[01:47.61]And your loved ones have been mangled
[01:49.55]Listen to the jingle jangle
[01:51.61]Of my gypsy tambourine
[01:53.60]'Cause these chords are hypnotizing
[01:55.60]And the whole world's harmonizing
[01:57.66]So please children stop your crying
[01:59.66]And just sing along with me
[02:01.59]When you've bungled all your bangles
[02:03.65]And your loved ones have been mangled
[02:05.58]Listen to the jingle jangle
[02:07.58]Of my gypsy tambourine
[02:09.58]'Cause these chords are hypnotizing
[02:11.63]And the whole world's harmonizing
[02:13.63]So please children stop your crying
[02:15.63]And just sing along with me
