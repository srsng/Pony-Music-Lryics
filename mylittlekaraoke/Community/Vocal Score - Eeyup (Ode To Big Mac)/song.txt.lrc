He's a stallion of very few words
There is seldom a sound to be heard
He's got big green eyes that shine in the sun
And I love to see them when the day's begun
His coat is red like the sweetest rose
Or more like the color of his apples I suppose
Those three little freckles on his cheeks
That bounce up and down when he finally speaks! Ooooh
I guess maybe I'm just a little bit messed up
But my heart skips a beat when he saysâ€¦
"Eeyup"!
That big green apple on his side
That gently sways with him in his stride
That dirty blonde mane and unkempt tail
Messy, yet perfect to the smallest detail!
He's a great big pony, he can fill any space
And unless he bends down I can't reach his face!
His apple-bucking makes him super strong too
You better hope that kick is never aiming at you! Ooh
I guess maybe I'm just a little bit messed up
But my heart skips a beat when he says "Eeyup"!
His voice is the softest baritone
And the harmonies are perfect when it's with my own
He's a caring pony anyone would agree
Just ask anypony in the Apple Family
I~~ guess I'm a little bit messed up
But my heart skips a beat when he says "Eeyup"!
Oooh I guess I'm maybe just a little bit messed up
But my heart skips a beat
Yes my heart skips a beat
Oooooh my heart skips a beat
When he says "Eeyup"!
