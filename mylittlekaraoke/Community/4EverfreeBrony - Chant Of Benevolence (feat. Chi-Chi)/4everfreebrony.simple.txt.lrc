Light of virtue shown
Sign of one's true form
To grow only small, giving gui~dance for all
Seen while hard~ly~ known
September Blue, thy sorrows be forgotten
October Auburn, let this season pass
Novem~ber~ Gray, re~store with thy~ rain
December White, thy beauty ever last
September Blue, thy sorrows be forgotten
October Auburn, let this season pass
Novem~ber~ Gray, re~store with thy~ rain
December White, thy beauty ever last
Ahhhh~~~~~~~
Ahhhh~~~~~~
Ahhhh~~~
December White, thy beauty ever last
