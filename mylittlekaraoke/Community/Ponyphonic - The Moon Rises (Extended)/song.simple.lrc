[00:17.51]Now the hour has come at last
[00:20.06]The soft and fading li~ght
[00:23.06]Has crossed the west horizon
[00:25.91]And has bidden us goodnight
[00:28.91]And what a lovely night it is
[00:32.06]To walk a moonlit field
[00:34.91]To see the softer shades
[00:37.16]That are by starlight now revealed
[00:40.83]So why is it that now
[00:43.53]When all is quiet and at re~st
[00:46.68]When candles glow and all the world
[00:49.61]Is at its very best
[00:52.53]The ponies of Equestria
[00:55.46]Should lock themselves away
[00:58.31]To shun the moo~n and wait instead
[01:01.31]For Sister's sunny day?
[01:09.86]In umbra Luna est
[01:14.51]Am I so wro~ng to wish that they
[01:17.36]Would see~ things like I do?
[01:20.81]And am I so wro~ng to think
[01:23.28]That the~y might lo~ve me too?
[01:26.36]Why shouldn't they adore me?
[01:29.43]Is it not within my right?
[01:32.21]I'll not be overshadowed!
[01:34.91]Mi~ne is not the lesser light!
[01:38.13]I've waited long enough now
[01:40.91]For them a~ll to come around
[01:43.46]And thou~gh the Sun may plead and threaten
[01:46.91]The Moon will stand her ground!
[01:59.77]Sister…
[02:01.91]It comes to this at last…
[02:04.08]I will no longer yield the sky
[02:07.08]If they cannot lo~ve
[02:08.96]But one princess alone
[02:13.46]See, the Moon is rising
[02:17.73]She has come to claim the heavens for her own
[02:24.33]And all will know the wonders
[02:27.56]Of my dark and jeweled sky
[02:30.56]When all the world is wrapped in
[02:33.33]An eternal lullaby
[02:36.33]So say “GOODNIGHT!” of this
[02:38.81]The final setting o~f the sun
[02:42.56]Tomorrow dawns in darkness
[02:45.41]The nighttime has
[02:48.56]BEGUN!
[02:49.68]Nocte!
[02:51.26]Hehehehe…
[02:52.53]Hahahahahahaha!
[02:54.33]HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
