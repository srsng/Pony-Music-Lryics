[00:11.85]The race has begun
[00:13.49]We must run fast
[00:14.80]Jump over the mud
[00:16.44]Hav ing a good time
[00:17.94]Where's Applejack?
[00:19.30]She fell in the mud
[00:20.99]Are you okay?
[00:22.44]We can still win this
[00:23.94]Jump in a bucket
[00:25.35]That looked like it hurts
[00:26.94]I know what pain is
[00:28.21]It's great to be alive
[00:29.89]But when I am feeling weak
[00:31.44]and when I am feel ing down
[00:32.94]She is there to lift me up
[00:34.44]Lift me up over this bo-ox
[00:36.13]Yes, I love my sister Applejack
[00:40.81]Bum bum bum
[00:41.94]Eating some pie
[00:43.49]No time to chew
[00:44.94]Pushing some hay
[00:46.44]No time to lose
[00:47.89]Pushing this hay really far
[00:49.49]Pushing hay is really hard!
[00:50.89]Running in a circle yes
[00:52.39]Having so much fun hooray
[00:53.94]Got to chuck some grapes?
[00:55.44]Throw them with your face!
[00:56.85]Sister toss and
[00:58.30]squish and squash and
[00:59.89]Mak ing tacky jelly
[01:01.44]Put it on your head
[01:02.85]We're gonna win the race
[01:04.30]Because I am a good racer
[01:05.94]I am running oh so fast
[01:07.39]Fun levels are to the max
[01:08.89]Applejack flies through the air
[01:10.39]Apples fall without a care
[01:11.89]Apples are not meant to fly!
[01:13.44]No apples get left behind
[01:14.94]When small things get kicked around
[01:16.44]They just might destroy the town
[01:23.89]When I'm feeling broken down
[01:25.39]She has always got my back
[01:26.94]Life is worth protecting now
[01:28.44]Place it in that giant ha-at
[01:30.03]Yes I love my sister Applejack
[01:33.31]Now we're racing towards the finish line
[01:35.52]Nothing matters once you die but we're along for the ride
[01:38.56]And you sacrifice some meaning just to have the words rhyme
[01:41.56]In the end it all comes down to just how far we can slide!
