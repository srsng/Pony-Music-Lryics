[00:23.60]There's something about that magic~ girl
[00:26.51]That brings a full stop to the whole~ world
[00:29.60]When I look in her eyes
[00:32.00]And suddenly nothing matters
[00:34.57]Inspiring me to face my~ fears
[00:37.49]Her magical spark brings me to~ tears
[00:40.57]All these years
[00:41.94]of me watching this show for little girls
[00:45.89]Everyday~ I look and~ try
[00:48.63]One day we'll~ see eye to eye
[00:51.20]I'll break the fourth wall just for you
[00:53.94]Reality can't hold us through
[00:56.51]This chick means the whole world to me~
[00:59.21] I just want everyone to see
[01:01.49]I'd give it my all
[01:03.63]Just~ to see her smile smile smile~
[01:07.49]These people they can boo me~
[01:10.19]This hate will never phase me
[01:12.24]'Cause the look in those eyes
[01:14.64]Makes this hell here all worthwhile~
[01:18.76]Twilight Sparkle you're my reason to live
[01:32.17]No other girl out there can com~pare
[01:35.09]Believe me I've looked just every~where
[01:38.13]And I swear
[01:39.50]From the bottom of my heart I mean this
[01:43.14]Your eyes are a beacon shining~ bright
[01:46.06]Your hair in the wind bringing to~ light
[01:49.14]All the feels
[01:50.47]It's too bad for me you don't even exist
[01:54.41]Everyday~ I look and~ try
[01:57.20]One day we'll~ see eye to eye
[01:59.77]I'll break the fourth wall just for you
[02:02.56]Reality can't hold us through
[02:05.09]This chick means the whole world to me~
[02:07.79]I just want everyone to see
[02:10.06]I'd give it my~ all
[02:12.20]Just~ to see her smile smile smile~
[02:16.06]These people they can boo me~
[02:18.76]This hate will never phase me
[02:20.81]'Cause the look in those eyes
[02:23.21]Makes this hell here all worthwhile~
[02:27.33]Twilight Sparkle you're my reason to live
[02:29.77]I dream of lying under the stars~
[02:32.86]next to you~
[02:35.17]With all this knowledge ain't there
[02:37.61]Someone there worth~ sharing to?
[02:40.57]And it hurts I'll never tell you~ this
[02:43.44]It hurts I'll never feel your face
[02:46.23]Three simple words~ to tell you that I~ love~ you~
[02:51.67]There's something about that magic~ girl
[02:54.59]That brings a full stop to the whole~ world
[02:57.71]When I look in her eyes
[03:00.11]And suddenly nothing matters
[03:03.37]Go!
[03:26.34]Everyday~ I look and try
[03:29.04]One day we'll~ see eye to eye
[03:31.66]I'll break the fourth wall just for you
[03:34.40]Reality can't hold us through
[03:36.97]This chick means the whole world to me~
[03:39.67]I just want everyone to see
[03:41.94]I'd give it my all
[03:44.09]Just~ to see her smile smile smile~
[03:47.94]These people they can boo me~
[03:50.64]This hate will never phase me
[03:52.70]'Cause the look in those eyes
[03:55.10]Makes this hell here all worthwhile~
[03:58.91]And though it seems impossible~
[04:01.61]There's no harm hoping one day
[04:03.71]That the girl of my dreams sees~
[04:06.46]Beyond the lighted stage~
[04:09.89]Till' then I'll hold you close~
[04:12.46]And I wrote this song to show you
[04:14.64]That I'm giving you my word
[04:17.13]I just hope I'll make you proud~
[04:21.37]And I'll keep on saying
[04:23.90]Twilight Sparkle you're my reason to live
[04:34.87]Twilight Sparkle you're my reason to live
