[00:04.10]I guess I'm up in spa-ace
[00:06.02]We-ell, what can you do?
[00:11.45]You shouldn't challenge fate
[00:13.37]When you're likely to lo-ose
[00:19.18]It's been a while since I took a vaca-ation
[00:26.38]I'll just relax and watch as they rai~se the~ sun
[00:33.31]So
[00:35.24]This is what it's like
[00:38.70]Ste-epping in sister's hooves
[00:42.36]And this is ho-ow it feels
[00:45.74]When you got nothing to lose
[00:49.79]And I can't he-elp but thi-ink
[00:53.21]Of everything I've done wrong
[00:56.21]But now that I kno-ow, it's a wonder
[01:00.56]Why I sent her here for so-o long
[01:03.76]La da la la
[01:05.57]La da la la
[01:07.45]La da la la da da da da da
[01:11.15]La da la la
[01:13.04]La da la la
[01:14.88]La da la la da da da da da
[01:17.96]It's been a couple weeks and I'm starting to shake
[01:25.28]I can't believe I thought I was taking a brea~k
[01:32.86]No walls to hold me in but I ca~n't brea~k out
[01:40.33]Of all the stars around me I'm lo-osi-ing count
[01:47.25]So
[01:49.10]This is what it's like
[01:52.57]Ste-epping in sister's hooves
[01:56.22]And this is ho-ow it feels
[01:59.57]When you got nothing to lose
[02:03.65]And I can't he-elp but thi-ink
[02:07.08]Of everything I've done wrong
[02:10.04]But now that I kno-ow, it's a wonder
[02:14.39]Why I sent her here for so-o long
[02:46.57]It's been a thousand years
[02:48.46]Never felt so alo-one
[02:53.92]I don't know what I learned
[02:55.73]I just want to go ho-ome
[03:01.51]I'm not the princess everyone kne-ew be-efore
[03:08.90]My sunlight hides away-y my sha-ado-owed core
[03:15.86]So
[03:17.71]This is what it's like
[03:21.18]Ste-epping in sister's hooves
[03:24.83]And this is ho-ow it feels
[03:28.18]When you got nothing to lose
[03:32.26]And I can't he-elp but thi-ink
[03:35.69]Of everything I've done wrong
[03:38.69]But now that I kno-ow, it's a wonder
[03:43.04]Why I sent her here for so-o long
[03:46.23]La da la la
