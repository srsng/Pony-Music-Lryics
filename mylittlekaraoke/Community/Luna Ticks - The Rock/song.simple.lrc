[00:03.19]She's been shrink~ing
[00:05.46]And no one knows~ why
[00:08.30]We've been think~ing
[00:10.97]Is she gonna die?
[00:13.24]I have an ink~ling
[00:15.84]Of when she's gonna stop
[00:21.63]When she becomes the rock~
[00:29.05]She's been turning grey
[00:31.41]Or is it just our eyes
[00:34.00]If she gets stuck this way
[00:36.59]Can we adjust our lives?
[00:39.47]Will she be okay
[00:41.78]Will we still hear her talk?
[00:47.66]When she becomes the rock
[01:05.42]Everything about her is~ big
[01:10.93]Except for her size
[01:15.88]Don't waste your time feeling sad for her
[01:19.00]You'll be sorry kid
[01:20.78]The time of Maud is on the rise
[01:24.15]Right before your eyes
[01:31.41]She's been getting hard
[01:33.72]Especially in her stare
[01:36.55]It's no lie this part~
[01:38.86]We're getting kinda scared
[01:41.50]So lock your doors at night
[01:44.09]'Cause you might hear a knock~~
[01:49.85]When she becomes the rock
[01:57.31]She's been getting smooth
[01:59.62]Does she still have~ fur
[02:02.26]There are no~ grooves
[02:04.81]Anywhere on~ her
[02:07.41]If you thought she was hard to move
[02:09.96]Well you're in for a shock~~
[02:15.84]When she becomes the rock~
[02:28.49]Everything about her is~ big
[02:34.00]Except for her size
[02:38.50]Don't waste your time feeling sad for her
[02:41.74]You'll be sorry that you did
[02:43.81]The time of Maud is on the rise
[02:47.26]Right before your eyes
