[00:05.35]Attention
[00:06.90]All Arcane pilots to battle stations
[00:10.20]All Arcane pilots to battle stations
[00:13.95]Enemies approaching
[00:15.70]On this day, a hundred years ago
[00:19.20]The pegasi reached a state of independence
[00:22.70]And we've kept it that way
[00:25.50]We're not gonna lose our freedom again
[00:28.25]Not today, not any day
[00:31.95]Hit 'em hard and don't hold back
[01:00.30]When I was small
[01:01.65]No one knew me at all
[01:03.15]I never trusted my wings
[01:04.90]'Cause I'd suffer the fall
[01:06.50]Mother said to me
[01:08.10]"There is more to see"
[01:09.90]She flew me so far
[01:11.35]And she showed me the stars
[01:13.05]I close my eyes, all I see is lies
[01:16.15]Just because I can't fly, doesn't mean I won't try
[01:19.50]I designed a creation that could soar across the nation
[01:22.55]With the wings and the grace of the Pegasus race
[01:25.95]These lights I see, they must be known
[01:29.00]And even if they're far from home
[01:32.25]With an aircraft I can call my own
[01:35.40]These evils shan't be left alone
[01:40.00]This is my domain
[01:41.50]I'll build the Pegasus Arcane
[01:43.30]Claim the freedom you stole for centuries
[01:46.45]I'll control the skies
[01:47.90]One day you'll meet your demise
[01:49.85]If you wish to be wise
[01:51.25]Don't f--- with these~ pegasi
[01:54.60]The best way to fly a Pegasus Arcane is to understand it
[01:57.95]Empty your mind, open your heart, loosen your muscles
[02:02.50]And don't forget to put your seatbelt on
[02:06.30]Lay down the blueprints, put your goggles on, get weld~ing
[02:09.25]Combine the elements to make some rocket fuel
[02:12.70]She needs some camouflage, some colours fit for fly~ing
[02:15.70]Brand it with your cutie mark, your ship is gonna rule
[02:37.70]I never saw my mother again
[02:40.90]Beyond the day they land~ed
[02:44.15]Her soul, my heart, were torn~ apart
[02:47.40]My memories left strand~ed
[02:50.50]But now it's time to recover the past
[02:53.70]Their powers ain't gonna last
[02:58.85]I'm losing power
[03:00.20]Commander, do you copy?
[03:02.50]Our ships have been part of us ever since we first flew them
[03:05.65]You're right soldier
[03:07.15]I was born with my arcane
[03:09.00]You can bet your ass I'm gonna go down with it
[03:18.10]Hit 'em hard until they fall
[03:19.70]All for one and one for all
[03:21.30]Live to fight and do or die
[03:22.90]That's the way, the way we fly
[03:24.50]Hit 'em hard until they fall
[03:26.15]All for one and one for all
[03:27.70]Live to fight and do or die
[03:29.30]That's the way, the way we fly
[03:30.90]Hit 'em hard until they fall
[03:32.55]All for one and one for all
[03:34.10]Live to fight and do or die
[03:35.70]That's the way, the way we fly
[03:37.30]Hit 'em hard until they fall
[03:38.90]All for one and one for all
[03:40.50]Live to fight and do or die
[03:42.10]That's the way (...)
[03:43.25]We believe in each other, let our powers work as one
[03:46.45]We'll be soaring together, till our work here is done
[03:49.60]Through the winds and the hail, in the snow and in the rain
[03:52.85]We'll be standing our ground, if you need us again
[03:56.00]This is our domain
[03:57.50]We fly the Pegasus Arcane
[03:59.25]Kept the freedom we've earned for centuries
[04:02.50]We control the skies
[04:03.90]Today will be your demise
[04:05.70]If you wish to be wise
[04:07.25]Don't f--- with these pegasi
[04:10.25]We fly the Pegasus Arcane
[04:12.10]Kept the freedom we've earned for centuries
[04:15.30]We control the skies
[04:16.70]Today will be your demise
[04:18.55]If you wish to be wise
[04:20.10]Don't f--- with these pegasi
