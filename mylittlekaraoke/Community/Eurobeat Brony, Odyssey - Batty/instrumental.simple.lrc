[00:40.17]I want to drain you of your colors
[00:46.24]You are the apple of my eye~~~~
[00:52.36]I'm going to stalk you into darkness
[00:58.09]Make you run away
[00:59.47]Make you run afraid of the night~~~~
[01:04.20]I'm not the friend you once knew
[01:07.26]Search your heart you know it's true
[01:10.32]There's no time to say goodbye
[01:13.38]This will be the end of your life~~
[01:18.77]I've gone batty~
[01:22.55]Lunatic under the moon~~
[01:24.89]I've gone batty~
[01:28.61]Once I sink my teeth in it'll happen to you~
[01:44.38]How red and juicy you are to me
[01:50.45]As if you're waiting for my bite~~~~
[01:56.61]My insanity has a flavor
[02:02.34]Heavenly and sweet
[02:03.68]Nectar of my terrible life~~~~
[02:08.46]I'm not the friend you once knew
[02:11.42]Search your heart you know it's true
[02:14.52]There's no time to say goodbye
[02:17.58]This will be the end of your life~~
[02:22.98]I've gone batty~
[02:26.70]Lunatic under the moon~~
[02:29.09]I've gone batty~

[03:00.81]I'm going to stalk you into darkness~
[03:06.50]Make you run away
[03:07.88]Make you run afraid of the night~~~~
[03:12.66]You thought you were rid of me
[03:15.62]A mistake as you will see
[03:18.68]I'll just wait for one more time
[03:21.74]For my darkest thirst to arrive~~
[03:39.32]I've gone batty~
[03:43.14]Lunatic under the moon~~
[03:45.48]I've gone batty~
[03:49.30]Once I sink my teeth in it'll happen to you~
