[00:33.70]It's been a while to~day
[00:36.62]Since I last saw your face
[00:39.70]Though ticking time creeps on so fast
[00:43.03]Dark is the shadow cast
[00:46.20]A light spills through anyway
[00:48.99]Cutting through my dark dismay
[00:51.16]I don't need your permission
[00:53.12]Won't be held to your disposition
[00:56.12]Are you~ proud~ of choices you've~ made
[01:01.37]Do you~ smile~ on the path you take
[01:07.70]Though the road has been long~, my time has come
[01:12.08]Make a choice~
[01:15.33]Do you know what's right
[01:17.37]Is their pain worth a coat of glowing fur
[01:20.41]It's time that you decide
[01:22.74]Make a choice
[01:25.62]Or else they'll choose a path for you
[01:27.87]Will you just stand idly by
[01:30.24]Or can you stand to do what you have to~
[01:37.37]Fillies mares and colts
[01:39.74]It seems our path is set
[01:41.70]Though I can't fix what was
[01:43.62]I'll keep~ on looking for~ward because~
[01:48.03]While you look at me
[01:50.49]With eyes telling stories
[01:52.33]Mares~ like me can't be trusted
[01:54.49]Those tales need to be readjusted
[01:57.33]Are you~ proud~ of choices you've~ made
[02:02.66]Do you~ smile~ on the path you take
[02:11.53]The time has come for me to
[02:34.70]Make a choice
[02:38.03]Do you know what's right
[02:40.08]Is their pain worth a coat of glowing fur
[02:42.99]It's time that you decide
[02:45.37]Make a choice~
[02:48.66]Do you know what's right
[02:50.74]Is their pain worth a coat of glowing fur
[02:53.66]It's time that you decide
[02:56.03]Make a choice~
[02:58.87]Or else they'll choose a path for you
[03:01.33]Will you just stand idly by
[03:03.58]Or can you stand to do what you have to~
[03:07.66]Your words that held me down
[03:10.33]Don't matter in the end~
[03:12.99]I'll turn this world around
[03:14.99]You can continue to pretend
[03:18.33]That showing them your heart~
[03:21.08]Is something you can't do
[03:23.70]I'll show them that there's love
[03:25.66]When showing love's all you refuse
