[00:07.62]Today I'll shine like I've never shone before
[00:11.31]And I will show the princess that I'm ready for more
[00:15.46]I'll dazzle her with magic, every spell~ that I've done
[00:18.98]And I'll prove to her I'm ready for my place in the~ sun~
[00:31.62]Today I'll be what I've never been before
[00:35.34]And I will take to the sky~ spread my wings and soar
[00:39.66]There's a brand new spark up in the sky~ today
[00:42.95]And as sure as night is dark
[00:44.80]We are on our way~
[00:55.62]Today I'll rise with the upper~ crust
[00:59.60]Fancy drinks, crystal glass
[01:01.44]Cider is a must!
[01:03.23]Clean your hooves, it's a big day!
[01:05.13]Hold your horses, they're okay!
[01:06.98]Sure as stubborn ponies squabble
[01:08.88]We are on our way~
[01:20.08]There'll be ponies laughing, ponies dancing, having so much fun!
[01:23.83]I cannot wait to celebrate everything with everyone
[01:27.46]All those thousands of ponies from every place under the sun!
[01:32.71]Thousands of ponies? Really?
[01:34.50]Of course!
[01:35.42]The Prince and Princess are coming back!
[01:36.69]It's the event of the century!
[01:38.05]Pinkie!
[01:39.03]Maybe I'll hide in a cupboard, lock the door-
[01:42.81]There won't be thousands of ponies there by far-
[01:45.75]Are you sure?
[01:46.87]I could find a little corner I could use for a day
[01:50.42]Don't listen to Pinkie Pie
[01:52.10]She's gone off the hay!
[01:55.82]And as sure as the Wonderbolt flies~
[01:59.54]We are on our way
[02:03.06]The bumpy road to Canterlot
[02:06.81]Flying free!
[02:07.67]Through dirt we'll trot!
[02:08.77]And we'll party!
[02:09.66]Maybe not!
[02:10.62]And sure as the moon is grey~
[02:16.10]We're on our way
