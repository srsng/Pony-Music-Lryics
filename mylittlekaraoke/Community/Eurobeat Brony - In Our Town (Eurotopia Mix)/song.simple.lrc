[00:14.82]Heads high, ponies!
[00:16.35]Marching proud!
[00:18.33]All together now, every one of you!
[00:21.39]Nopony left behind!
[00:36.33]Life is so grand in our town
[00:39.17]We're always filled with cheer
[00:42.20]We never have to look around
[00:45.22]To know that we're all here
[00:48.06]In our town, in our town
[00:51.42]We don't have to wait
[00:54.11]To find out that our destiny
[00:57.28]Is just to emulate
[01:02.29]Let's see those big, happy smiles
[01:05.02]Life is a smile in our town
[01:07.78]Our Cutie Marks the same
[01:10.81]Because we do not separate
[01:13.83]Ourselves by more than name
[01:16.67]In our town, in our town
[01:20.07]We dare not compete
[01:23.09]Winning only breeds the worst
[01:26.23]Ego-filled conceit
[01:28.10]You see, now everypony wins
[01:33.70]Life is a joy in our town
[01:36.65]We're all equal here
[01:39.79]No-one is superior
[01:42.55]And no-one shakes in fear
[01:45.50]In our town, in our town
[01:48.83]We work as a team
[01:51.81]You can't have a nightmare
[01:54.84]If you never dream
[01:59.43]Other ponies argue
[02:02.01]Do you ever wonder why?
[02:05.00]When you think your talent's special
[02:08.25]You don't see eye to eye
[02:11.12]There's just too many differences
[02:14.26]That lead to disarray
[02:17.25]But when you learn to act as one
[02:20.24]It's like a holiday
[02:23.19]In our town, in our town
[02:26.51]We don't complicate
[02:29.54]When you learn to simplify
[02:32.56]Life is oh so great
[02:35.59]Join in our utopia
[02:38.65]Come out of the dark
[02:41.67]Banded by equality
[02:44.63]By our Cutie mark
