Someone tell me
Someone show me
Someone let me~ know
Who I'm supposed to be
If you know me
You can take~ me
To the~ deep blue sky
Over the big~ blue sea
I know
Where I'll be
Oh please
I can dream
I'm lost
And behind
But I found
My light
I know
Where I'll be
Oh please
I can dream
I'm lost
And behind
But I found
My light
I know
Where I'll be
Oh please
I can dream
I'm lost
And behind
But I found
My light
Oooh~ ooh ooh ooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh
Oooh~
If you've seen
In the future
Tell me
What you see there
Within
All the madness
I can shine
In the darkness
Into the hour of night
Where my pain gets left~ behind
I won't give up the fight
I'll just say that I don't mind
What would you do to me
If I set the universe free
Come~ sit~ next to me
Behold your galaxy
If you've seen
In the future
Tell me
What you see there
Within
All the madness
I can shine
In the darkness
If you've seen
In the future
Tell me
What you see there
Within
All the madness
I can shine
In the darkness
Oooh
Ooh ooh~ ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oooh
