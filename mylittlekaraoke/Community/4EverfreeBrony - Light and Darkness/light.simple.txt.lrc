Someone tell me
Someone show me
Someone let me~ know
Who I'm supposed to be
If you know me
You can take~ me
To the~ deep blue sky
Over the big~ blue sea
I know
Where I'll be
Oh please
I can dream
I'm lost
And behind
But I found
My light
I know
Where I'll be
Oh please
I can dream
I'm lost
And behind
But I found
My light
I know
Where I'll be
Oh please
I can dream
I'm lost
And behind
But I found
My light
Oooh~ ooh ooh ooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh
Oooh~
