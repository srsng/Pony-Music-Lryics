[00:41.76]Sometimes I think my head is filled with clouds
[00:46.01]Kicking up a storm when I feel~ down
[00:49.76]I can't put it in words~ like you can
[00:54.26]Though it don't matter 'cause you understand
[00:57.76]Sometimes I think that I am overwhelmed
[01:02.26]By the vastness of my realm
[01:06.26]Reaching up the sun splits in five
[01:10.26]And somehow I know I'm alive
[01:16.19]I'm alive
[01:20.26]I'm alive
[01:22.88]Woah I know~ I'm alive
[01:28.44]Alive
[01:30.01]Ripping up the sky, I leave my mark
[01:33.76]And though I'm not quite there, I feel a part
[01:37.69]Of something more than just~ me
[01:42.51]And I know I'm meant to be
[01:46.01]Leaving co~lours in my wake
[01:53.94]Leaving co~lours in my wake~~~~~~
[02:05.76]Sometimes I think the weight will make me fall
[02:10.32]And yet I don't seem to care at all
[02:14.44]Maybe 'cause I don't believe
[02:18.26]That I obey the laws of gravity
[02:24.26]I can fly
[02:28.32]I can fly
[02:32.76]I~ can~ fly~~~~~~
[02:50.19]And nothing can stop me~
[02:53.94]Ripping up the sky, I leave my mark
[02:57.69]And though I'm not quite there, I feel a part
[03:01.63]Of something more than just~ me
[03:06.44]And I know I'm meant to be
[03:09.94]Ripping up the sky, I leave my mark
[03:13.69]And though I'm not quite there, I feel a part
[03:17.63]Of something more than just~ me
[03:22.44]And I know I'm meant to be
[03:26.01]Leaving co~lours in my wake
[03:33.94]Leaving co~lours in my wake
[03:41.94]Leaving co~lours in my wake
[03:49.94]Leaving colours in my wake~~~
