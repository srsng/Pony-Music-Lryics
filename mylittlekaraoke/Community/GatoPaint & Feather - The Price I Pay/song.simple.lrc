[00:16.00]My heart
[00:17.82]So full
[00:19.69]So ready to give to you
[00:23.44]And when you ask
[00:27.20]I give without a second glance 'cause
[00:31.01]I want you
[00:32.88]To have to
[00:35.17]Want for nothing my~ friends
[00:45.95]And when they say
[00:49.70]That they want more, I obey~
[00:53.92]Want for nothing my~ friends
[01:00.96]But you didn't have to take~ it all~~~
[01:08.46]But you wanted every piece~ of me~~
[01:15.96]I was willing to give you more
[01:19.72]And you took ungratefully
[01:23.47]But I guess that's the price I pay
[01:28.39]For being generosi~ty~~~
[01:35.89]For being generosi~ty~~~
[01:45.98]I want to
[01:47.85]Go back to
[01:50.90]When I could give you all you needed
[01:56.76]I could give you all you needed
[02:00.75]But now I'm beat down
[02:02.86]I'm sprawling
[02:04.73]I can't walk
[02:06.61]I'm crawling
[02:09.42]Could I never give you all you wanted~~?
[02:15.99]But you didn't have to take~ it all~~~
[02:23.49]But you wanted every piece~ of me~~
[02:30.99]I was willing to give you more
[02:34.75]And you took ungratefully
[02:38.50]But I guess that's the price I~ pay
[02:43.42]For being generosi~ty~~~
[02:50.92]For being generosi~ty~~~
