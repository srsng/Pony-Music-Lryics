[00:23.59]The trees ablaze with reds and oranges whisper to the wind
[00:30.38]They rustle secrets to each other
[00:35.65]The clouds respond with vacant tears as they leave the trees behind
[00:42.40]But their responses grow ever colder~
[00:48.81]The days grow glum~ it's time to wrap up everypony
[01:00.79]The days grow glum~ with warm smiles~ in every window~
[01:23.81]Though we all lay all snug at home with our backs turned to the breeze
[01:30.40]We hear the words they speak through our windows
[01:35.87]The day has come to lend a hoof to help us say goodbye
[01:42.50]The days wave thanks~ as they grow ever colder~
[01:48.76]The days grow glum~ it's time to wrap up everypony
[02:00.74]The days grow numb~ with warm smiles~ in every window~
[02:12.76]The days grow glum~ it's time to wrap up everypony
[02:24.74]The days grow numb~ with warm smiles~ in every window~
[04:24.80]The days grow glum~ it's time to wrap up everypony
[04:36.78]The days grow numb~ with warm smiles~ in every window~
[04:59.99]As we run on through the leaves we leave our tears behind
[05:06.44]The trees try to follow if they're able
[05:11.59]Our task complete we head back home snuggle up warm in our graves
[05:18.42]And we look forward to next November~
[05:36.73]The days grow glum~ it's time to wrap up everypony
[05:48.75]The days grow numb~ with warm smiles~ in every window~
[06:00.74]The days grow glum~ it's time to wrap up everypony
[06:12.76]The days grow numb~ with warm smiles~ in every window~
