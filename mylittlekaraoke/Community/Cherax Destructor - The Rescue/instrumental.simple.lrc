[00:32.62]Lying facedown drunk on the sidewalk thinking of her
[00:40.62]Is it love or all of this booze
[00:43.88]That's got me confused?
[00:46.19]I'm not sure~
[00:49.12]It's late and it's cold
[00:52.88]And you just called to say hello
[00:57.12]I should be there for you
[01:05.19]I could be your rescue
[01:13.12]You need each other
[01:17.12]Go to her, go to her
[01:21.12]No time to wonder
[01:25.19]Go to her~, go to her
[01:29.12]How long you've yearned for this
[01:32.88]An end to all your loneliness
[01:36.88]Now you've earned this sweet success~~~~~~
[02:04.62]After all these years spent alone
[02:07.88]I'm finally found
[02:12.62]Feel my heart in straight-time pound
[02:15.88]To the beat of this strange new~ sound
[02:20.81]I'm so drunk on you
[02:24.88]The way you move, your sunset tunes
[02:29.12]Nothing's how we'd planned it
[02:33.12]One more step towards me
[02:36.88]We have to take this gamble
[02:41.62]With your shaking body
[02:45.19]You need each other
[02:49.06]Go to her, go to her
[02:53.12]Don't stop to wonder
[02:57.12]Go to her~, go to her
[03:01.19]Every moment's led to this
[03:05.12]Flustered glance and fumbled kiss
[03:08.88]Now you deserve this happiness~~~~~~
[03:35.12]Take you through the cold and snow
[03:43.12]To that place we've never known
[03:51.19]I just need to let you~ know
