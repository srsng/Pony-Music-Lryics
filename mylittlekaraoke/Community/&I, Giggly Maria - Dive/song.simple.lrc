[01:07.73]I do not worry, I'm never in a hurry
[01:11.07]The past so far is just fine, I'll take it, risk it
[01:15.29]The time that you've spent locked up with decisions
[01:18.57]Has hindered more than aided, I'll free you, free you
[01:23.20]Don't need a plan, the fun is unknown
[01:26.54]I'm never alone, I've got you, got you
[01:30.76]Don't need a map, the fun's adventure
[01:34.04]And all I've risked yet - Dive in, dive in!
[01:39.61]Dive in, dive in
[01:43.36]Dive in, dive in
[01:47.11]Dive in, dive in
[02:52.73]I do not worry, I'm never in a hurry
[02:56.07]The past so far is just fine, I'll take it, risk it
[03:00.29]The time that you've spent locked up with decisions
[03:03.57]Has hindered more than aided, I'll free you, free you
[03:08.20]Don't need a plan, the fun is unknown
[03:11.54]I'm never alone, I've got you, got you
[03:15.76]Don't need a map, the fun's adventure
[03:19.04]And all I've risked yet - Dive in, dive in!
[03:24.61]Dive in, dive in
[03:28.36]Dive in, dive in
[03:32.11]Dive in, dive in
[03:52.27]I hear the wind rushing past my ears
[03:55.78]As I start to think, are they listening?
[03:59.59]As I fly so fast, farther than they'd dare
[04:03.40]'Cause my heart is full, theirs is filled with fear
[04:07.09]'Cause they can't let go, they keep holding on
[04:10.84]To the past, scared to be out of control
[04:14.59]They will never know of this thrill, just think
[04:18.57]That I'm cra~zy, when I dive in
[04:39.67]Dive in, dive in
[04:43.36]Dive in, dive in
[04:47.17]Dive in, dive in
