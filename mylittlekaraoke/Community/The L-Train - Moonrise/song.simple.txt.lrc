Daybreak comes on a cold lonely morn
Castle in ruins
And tapestry torn~~
As the moon finally sets
All the world’s left to mourn
Princess and people forlorn
Sister my dear
I’m all on my own
If I could have saved you
If I could have known
Though much time will pass I’ll love you evermore
But the sunrise lifts their hearts from the dark~
The dawn bringing light bringing hope
We will rebuild for our spirit is strong~
And Harmony will be restored~~
