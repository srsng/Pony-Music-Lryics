[00:52.83]What is wrong, my subjects?
[00:54.98]Is the moon not to your liking?
[00:59.02]Perhaps you just don’t see
[01:01.27]The endless sea of black,
[01:03.52]And all of the stars so striking
[01:07.69]Do you dare to anger me?
[01:09.75]Is it so hard
[01:11.62]To give up the way things are?
[01:14.91]Do you not see the wonders I create?
[01:18.42]Why do you hide
[01:20.30]Away from the night and stars~?
[01:23.62]Did I deserve your fear and hate~?
[01:27.14]Well no more
[01:28.45]Usher the coming storm
[01:30.66]Let darkness flood the morn
[01:32.86]And swallow every wayward light
[01:35.95]Lay the seas and mountains
[01:38.16]Under blackened heavens
[01:40.27]Bow now citizens
[01:42.23]Unto the throne of night
[01:44.95]Rise now regal~ moon
[01:47.16]All the world consume
[01:53.72]Tremble at the sight
[01:55.87]The eternal night
[01:58.17]What’s become of you sister?
[02:00.47]Don’t you see your own soul wan~ing?
[02:04.59]While this anger burns for me~
[02:06.98]Please give me a chance
[02:09.14]To save all that is remain~ing
[02:13.22]And end this war I plea!
[02:15.14]Stow your scorn
[02:16.41]Call off your hellish swarm
[02:18.66]Our people won’t be torn
[02:20.81]Because of your fiery spite
[02:23.86]Free them from your vengeance
[02:26.11]Or you’ll pay the penance
[02:28.27]Must you make me cast
[02:30.19]The sentence for this blight?
[02:33.00]Dearest sister Luna
[02:35.62]What have you~ done?
[02:41.72]Can’t you see the monster
[02:44.39]You have be~come?
[03:52.27]Sound the battle horn
[03:54.28]As all the world will mourn
[03:56.44]When family love’s forlorn
[03:58.55]For warriors and might
[04:00.84]Beloved alicorns
[04:02.95]The angels we’d adorn
[04:05.16]With majesty, will war
[04:07.31]And we will bear the plight
[04:10.22]New allegiance will rise
[04:12.75]Thirsting for demise
[04:18.75]The winds will carry the ring
[04:21.37]Of walls crumbling
[04:27.42]The stage is set for the clash
[04:30.14]The magic is~ cast
[04:36.42]As the battle begins
