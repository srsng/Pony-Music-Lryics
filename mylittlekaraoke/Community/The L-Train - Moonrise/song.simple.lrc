[03:40.73]Gather 'round my children
[03:42.94]Because now the time has come
[03:46.45]To tell you of the angels
[03:48.89]Of the dusk and of the dawn
[03:52.45]The ones whose very voices
[03:54.94]Hold sway over night and day~
[03:58.27]And the ponies of their magic kingdom
[04:01.64]Following their ways~
[04:04.59]Land so bountiful
[04:06.14]Free and beautiful
[04:07.64]Filled with joy and praise
[04:10.97]Heavenly waltz of the sky
[04:13.27]Inspire the ones who see
[04:16.97]All the hearts beat as one
[04:19.36]In Harmony
[04:34.50]By day the light and warmth
[04:36.52]Bring ease to all their busy toil
[04:40.45]The ponies planting for the harvest
[04:43.64]From the fertile soil
[04:46.45]By night when work is done
[04:48.52]The hours of rest are theirs to keep
[04:52.45]To talk and laugh and play with friends
[04:55.31]Or drift away to sleep
[04:58.69]Held so tenderly
[05:00.19]Kept in harmony
[05:01.69]Loved by night and day
[05:05.06]Heavenly waltz of the sky
[05:07.31]Inspire the ones who see
[05:11.02]All the hearts beat as one

[06:10.55]Land so bountiful
[06:12.14]Free and beautiful
[06:13.69]Filled with joy and praise
[06:16.97]Heavenly waltz of the sky
[06:19.41]Inspire the ones who see
[06:23.02]All the hearts beat as one
[06:25.27]In Harmony
[06:29.02]Faithfully side by side
[06:31.36]The blood that bonds us deep
[06:35.39]May we rule and love in unity
[08:30.98]Twinkling stars of every size
[08:34.64]Adorn the canvas of the skies
[08:38.53]Captivate and mesmerize
[08:42.05]And usher in the moonrise
[08:45.05]Wait! Hold on, don’t close your eyes
[08:49.12]Would you waste this evening so divine?
[08:52.83]Would you lie and not arise
[08:55.83]And slumber through creation at its prime?
[08:59.81]Ruling from a silent throne
[09:02.91]Her majesty ignored
[09:06.23]Leaving her tender breaking heart
[09:09.33]To fracture all alone
[09:11.81]And so a wicked seed
[09:14.58]Began to grow and~ grow
[09:18.98]Twisting up her loving mind
[09:21.98]With sharp and hateful~ thorns
[09:26.34]Don’t they see how hard I try?
[09:29.58]Is my night not worthy for them?
[09:32.81]Do they think they can deny
[09:35.34]My royal right?
[09:36.98]Let’s see them try to hide
[09:41.95]{laughter}
[10:09.23]No more will the moon be eclipsed
[10:12.05]By selfish blinding scorching sunlight
[10:16.64]Gaze upon the dusk of a new age
[10:19.64]The lunar throne will take its rightful place
[11:25.92]Dies
[11:30.28]Iræ
[11:34.64]Dies
[11:39.05]Umbra
[11:43.92]What is wrong, my subjects?
[11:46.08]Is the moon not to your liking?
[11:50.11]Perhaps you just don’t see
[11:52.36]The endless sea of black,
[11:54.61]And all of the stars so striking
[11:58.78]Do you dare to anger me?
[12:00.84]Is it so hard
[12:02.72]To give up the way things are?
[12:06.00]Do you not see the wonders I create?
[12:09.52]Why do you hide
[12:11.39]Away from the night and stars~?
[12:14.72]Did I deserve your fear and hate~?
[12:18.23]Well no more
[12:19.55]Usher the coming storm
[12:21.75]Let darkness flood the morn
[12:23.95]And swallow every wayward light
[12:27.05]Lay the seas and mountains
[12:29.25]Under blackened heavens
[12:31.36]Bow now citizens
[12:33.33]Unto the throne of night
[12:36.05]Rise now regal~ moon
[12:38.25]All the world consume
[12:44.81]Tremble at the sight
[12:46.97]The eternal night
[12:49.27]What’s become of you sister?
[12:51.56]Don’t you see your own soul wan~ing?
[12:55.69]While this anger burns for me~
[12:58.08]Please give me a chance
[13:00.23]To save all that is remain~ing
[13:04.31]And end this war I plea!
[13:06.23]Stow your scorn
[13:07.50]Call off your hellish swarm
[13:09.75]Our people won’t be torn
[13:11.91]Because of your fiery spite
[13:14.95]Free them from your vengeance
[13:17.20]Or you’ll pay the penance
[13:19.36]Must you make me cast
[13:21.28]The sentence for this blight?
[13:24.09]Dearest sister Luna
[13:26.72]What have you~ done?
[13:32.81]Can’t you see the monster
[13:35.48]You have be~come?
[14:43.36]Sound the battle horn
[14:45.38]As all the world will mourn
[14:47.53]When family love’s forlorn
[14:49.64]For warriors and might
[14:51.94]Beloved alicorns
[14:54.05]The angels we’d adorn
[14:56.25]With majesty, will war
[14:58.41]And we will bear the plight
[15:01.31]New allegiance will rise
[15:03.84]Thirsting for demise
[15:09.84]The winds will carry the ring
[15:12.47]Of walls crumbling
[15:18.52]The stage is set for the clash
[15:21.23]The magic is~ cast
[15:27.52]As the battle begins
[18:49.64]Daybreak comes on a cold lonely morn
[18:55.73]Castle in ruins
[18:58.59]And tapestry torn~~
[19:01.73]As the moon finally sets
[19:04.69]All the world’s left to mourn
[19:08.77]Princess and people forlorn
[19:15.33]Sister my dear
[19:18.05]I’m all on my own
[19:21.56]If I could have saved you
[19:24.80]If I could have known
[19:28.22]Though much time will pass I’ll love you evermore
[19:34.97]But the sunrise lifts their hearts from the dark~
[19:41.20]The dawn bringing light bringing hope
[19:48.09]We will rebuild for our spirit is strong~
[19:54.09]And Harmony will be restored~~
[21:11.95]Nightmare Moon sealed away in lunar prison
[21:16.45]Life will go on in the kingdom below
[21:20.95]All is set right in the world for a season
[21:25.45]'Til her release when this story is closed
[21:29.58]The stars will aid in her escape
[21:32.53]Return to where the battle raged
[21:35.53]The elements will wash away
[21:38.62]The darkness and the pain
[21:41.95]My little ponies the horror has ended
[21:46.45]Luna will pay for the crime she has done
[21:50.95]Don’t let her sins fill your mind up with hatred
[21:55.27]Forgiveness is all I can ask of you now
[22:00.33]For the future is bright
[22:02.58]Golden age within sight
[22:04.88]If you let love lead the way
[22:08.91]Now the sunrise lifts us up from the dark~
[22:13.27]The dawn bringing light, bringing hope

[22:22.22]And Harmony will be restored~
[23:25.78]Listen now my children
[23:28.22]For the meaning of her fall
[23:32.16]A heart that’s left abandoned
[23:34.88]Causes sadness in us all
[23:38.81]So love your fellow ponies
[23:41.48]Show a kindness unrestrained
[23:45.42]And Harmony will follow you for all~ of your days~
