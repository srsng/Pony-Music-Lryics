Try not to turn around, they may just be there
If you try to run away, you'd better be scared~ mare
Think you can solve your problem by closing your eyes
You've been deceived filly, there's just nothing but lies
You failed to defend yourself against the changelings
But I'll try~ to find a different way~~
This is like war just on the door like another day
You know if this gets real you gonna pay~
Try not to turn around, they may just be there
If you try to run away, you'd better be scared~ mare
Think you can solve your problem by closing your eyes
You've been deceived filly, there's just nothing but lies
