[00:14.00]A flash of colour and she's gone no one can hope to pursue
[00:17.43]A flank of red and white and yellow and cerulean blue
[00:20.86]And making rainbows awesome since October two thousand ten
[00:24.29]Another day a rush of wind and she'll be at it again
[00:27.71]Those airborne virtuosics are the stuff of legends and more
[00:31.14]The name is Rainbow Dash and I suspect you've heard it before
[00:34.57]Now if you come with me you'll find her where she takes her repose
[00:38.00]You won't forget her quickly once you see her as she well knows

[00:55.14]If ever you're in need of help she will show up with a smile
[00:58.57]And indescribable velocity impeccable style
[01:02.00]Agility in spades and pegasine charisma to match
[01:05.43]And when you're falling you can count on her to be there to catch
[01:08.86]Don't be alarmed if she does not appear as soon as you shout
[01:12.28]You know she probably just stopped to give some autographs out
[01:15.71]To call her narcissistic is an understatement and yet
[01:19.14]She's just that good it's not surprising that it goes to her head

[02:10.35]When the world seems everfree
[02:17.21]Coloured winds blow through my mind
[02:24.07]Everything is left behind
[02:48.28]Now Rainbow Dash I think you could do worse than listen to me
[02:51.71]Though you're spectacular it's probable your friends would agree
[02:55.14]Your self aggrandising demeanour is ungracious and cruel
[02:58.57]As if you're insecure and compensating don't be a fool
[03:02.00]You know you'll never be a Wonderbolt until you admit
[03:05.42]You need to lift your game and act as if you really want it
[03:08.85]Still busy napping when you could be out perfecting your art
[03:12.28]So much potential
