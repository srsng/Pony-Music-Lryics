[00:11.39]We are friends, are we not?
[00:13.65]And our interests are the same
[00:16.04]We collaborate
[00:17.21]And trust in fate to parcel out the blame
[00:20.27]There are ends we've all got
[00:22.50]That can justify the means
[00:24.96]We negotiate
[00:26.15]Then fabricate the facts behind the scenes
[00:29.91]Keeping all the details vague and secrets hi-iden
[00:34.04]Safe on the balanced sheet of those you trust
[00:37.29]Because
[00:38.49]History is a story told
[00:40.29]By the winners of a fight
[00:42.38]You imply a little, lie a little
[00:43.78]Testify and try a little
[00:44.84]Sailor
[00:46.94]Who's gonna question what goes on
[00:48.74]In the middle of the night?
[00:50.86]Not a tinker, Not a tailor
[00:51.93]Not his father or Mercedes
[00:52.99]Or a jailor
[00:56.95]So we all are agreed
[00:59.14]Lets be vigilant and wise
[01:01.51]We must all pretend our naive friend
[01:03.73]Was caught in his o-own li -ies
[01:05.86]For our plan to succeed
[01:07.99]We must share but one belief
[01:10.22]Edmund Dantes stays and ends his days
[01:12.61]Inside the Ch√¢teau d'If
[01:15.14]Where the softest things he'll touch
[01:16.84]Are stones and da -arkness
[01:19.33]Deep in the craggy isle and dungeon's keep
[01:22.72]Because
[01:23.82]History is a story told
[01:25.65]By the men who make the laws
[01:27.71]We supply a little lie
[01:28.71]To help the gullible to buy a little fable
[01:32.27]What will become of the righteous men
[01:34.20]Who fashioned Dantes' flaws?
[01:36.33]The rich and well respected
[01:37.29]Are no more to be rejected at our table
[01:40.85]I'll be a comfort in her time of grief and anguish
[01:45.07]I'll be Mercedes' ever faithful acolyte
[01:48.23]Every night
[01:49.23]A part of me wishes Dantes didn't have to languish
[01:53.85]But I can see it's him or me
[01:55.41]Let him sit there and rot till he's forgotten
[01:57.51]Let him ro-ot!
[02:00.10]History is a story told
[02:01.90]By the people who survive
[02:03.99]Let me sign and then initial
[02:05.03]It's the truth if it's officially the story
[02:08.48]What if the cost is one young man
[02:10.31]So three more men can survive?
[02:12.34]He's a price we have to pay
[02:13.31]To live and fight another day for love and glory
[02:16.86]He was standing in the way
[02:17.73]Of precious justice set on sail
[02:19.23]So goes the story
[02:21.29]Stick to the story
[02:23.38]Here ends the story!
