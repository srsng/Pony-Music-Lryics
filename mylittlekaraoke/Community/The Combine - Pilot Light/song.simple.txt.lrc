Wings that can't fly
They aren't wings at all
But he told me he believed~~
And now I'm on fire~
And I'm flying higher
Than I ever dreamed before~~
You got~ me soa~rin'
There's just one chance, one moment
Hold it fast, don't blow it
You got to stay~ strong
I'll tell you what he told me
That "yes, you are worthy"
"In the sky~ you belong"
Now pick yourself up, do it
You're a Wonderbolt? Then prove it!
Your heart won't steer you wrong
I can see that you've got talent
You're tough, you're smart, you're gallant
Colt, ain't you gonna soar
I'm not a mare to lie
I just can't deny
I think I've seen you before
Could it be that I, I know you?
Can you see it too?
I want to know you more~~~
