[00:09.00]Well Derpy wrecked the roof
[00:10.67]With her clumsy little hooves
[00:12.52]So they had to get some bits to fix it up
[00:16.62]Rainbow tried her best
[00:18.23]But Derpy is the best
[00:20.19]At derping up and making a big mess
[00:24.00]AJ said she'd win the prize
[00:25.62]They stomped the ground and watched her smile
[00:27.69]When she said she'd give it all away
[00:31.15]So she took the train to Canterlot
[00:33.23]Thought she'd go and win a lot
[00:34.96]For all her friends back there in Ponyville
[00:38.60]Well a week went by and they all cried
[00:40.50]When AJ scribed and said goodbye
[00:42.52]Sayin' that she wasn't coming back
[00:46.15]Didn't know why but they couldn't stand by
[00:47.83]So they ran out the door and the pegasus fly
[00:49.67]To search the town for Applejack
[00:53.54]Poor little AJ lost her pride
[00:55.27]It made her hide it made her cry
[00:57.06]She couldn't show her face in town again
[01:00.69]She ran away 'cause she lost the game
[01:02.54]And got a job for the pay
[01:04.62]Buckin' cherry trees for some bits
[01:08.13]And Cherry Jubilee was just as nice as she could be
[01:11.37]But Applejack was hiding facts and dodging questions
[01:15.63]So Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie
[01:17.60]tried to get her to confess
[01:19.21]And put her to the test with cherry chimmy chongas
[01:23.13]Kumquat picklebarrel made her crack
[01:24.87]'Cause she couldn't really take much more of that
[01:26.60]And so she said she tell them all what happened
[01:30.35]But she broke her pinkie promise and Pinkie raged
[01:32.08]So they stole a cart and began to chase
[01:33.98]'Cause friendship is persistent
[01:37.85]Tears were shed and much was said
[01:39.52]As AJ told the truth about the reason she left
[01:42.69]And said i'm sorry
[01:45.12]But it doesn't matter if you didn't win
[01:46.96]It's who ya are beneath your skin
[01:48.92]Wouldn't be the same here without you
[01:52.38]'Cause we all love you
[01:56.31]Here in Ponyville, Equestria
[02:00.06]We all love you
[02:03.69]Here in Ponyville, Equestria
