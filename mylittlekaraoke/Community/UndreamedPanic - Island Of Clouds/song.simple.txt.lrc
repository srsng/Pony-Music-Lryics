Let go of your stress tonight
Spread your wings and fly with the stars so bright
An island in the distance waits for us
All our friends are there so what's all the fuss
And I've never seen a place like this
Tonight is a night you don't want to miss
Nothing in the sky could ever amount
To this amazing Island in the clouds
the Island in the clouds
It feels like a rush of purpose and lust
I am happy I know someone I can trust
Your past is in the past and your future is grand
Don't let it bother you because we got better plans
And I've never seen a place like this
Tonight is a night you don't want to miss
Nothing in the sky could ever amount
To this amazing Island in the clouds
the Island in the clouds
Oh wahohwahoh wahohwahoh
Oh wahohwahoh wahohwahoh
We will be
the center of attention the center of attention
We will be
the center of attention the center of attention
We will be
the center of attention the center of attention
And I've never seen a place like this
Tonight is a night you don't want to miss
Nothing in the sky could ever amount
To this amazing Island in the clouds
the Island in the clouds
Oh ohwahoh wahoh
I've dreamed of this night for a very long time
So please stay with me tonight
