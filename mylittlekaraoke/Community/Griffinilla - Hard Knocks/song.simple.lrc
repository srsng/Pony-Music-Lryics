[00:00.35]I work the hardest when the sun is setting
[00:06.37] I play the numbers but I keep forgetting
[00:12.35] My broken heart, my beating chest
[00:15.42] My blackened scars, my bated breath
[00:18.37] My callus lungs, my empathy
[00:21.35] My tired eyes, my hopes and dreams
[00:24.75] I don't want to work myself to death
[00:27.75] I don't want to break your concentration
[00:30.82] Can I ever learn to love myself
[00:33.73] Will I ever cure my loneliness
[00:36.77] I don't wanna heed my own advice
[00:39.75] I don't wanna feed my desperation
[00:42.80] Even when the dirges start to play
[00:45.73] Maybe I'll enjoy the silence
[00:48.35] A marble counter and a plastic ghetto
[00:54.35] A candy corset and a pink stiletto
[01:00.33] My tangled mane, my tattered seams
[01:03.35] My tiny thoughts, my reveries
[01:06.35] My weathered veins, my hollow frame
[01:09.35] My horoscope, my twisted fate
[01:12.73] I don't want to work myself to death
[01:15.73] I don't want to break your concentration
[01:18.82] Can I ever learn to love myself
[01:21.70] Will I ever cure my loneliness
[01:24.75] I don't wanna heed my own advice
[01:27.73] I don't wanna feed my desperation
[01:30.77] Even when the dirges start to play
[01:33.70] Maybe I'll enjoy the silence
[01:36.91] Hard Knocks felt worn as the 9 to 5 tea parties rolled on
[01:42.63] dreamlike, everything tinted by the soft salmon horizon
[01:48.89] guided by giant little invisible hands of fate
[01:55.19] she prayed some far dreamer would take her away
[02:00.33] And when the doctor writes his last prescription
[02:06.33] He'll shake his head to stave my sad addiction
[02:12.33] My swollen neck, my second skin
[02:15.30] My bloodied socks, my crooked chin
[02:18.35] My wooden teeth, my splintered spine
[02:21.30] My gauze, my pain, my god, my name
[02:24.73] I don't want to work myself to death
[02:27.73] I don't want to break your concentration
[02:30.80] Can I ever learn to love myself
[02:33.70] Will I ever cure my loneliness
[02:36.70] I don't wanna live my life alone
[02:39.68] I don't wanna plead with my own shadow
[02:42.70] Baby when the hard knock life is won
[02:45.70] Do you think I'll stop forgetting
