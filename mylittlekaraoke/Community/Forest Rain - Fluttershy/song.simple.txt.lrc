A beautiful heart, so strong and true
A gentle touch that I always turn to
Yeah, she helps me pull through
These walls that I built up around
Crumble down with that wondrous sound
This timid voice that I've found
Her head upon my shoulder...
As she whispers in my ear...
The hurt we keep inside, it burns
And when we never speak, we learn
Our silence has more power than we realize
But when we let it out, and cry
And through tears we speak our minds
And find the words that ring true to our heart
Every day becomes better than the last
Her words, so soft, a pleasant plea
She voiced those thoughts that lived inside of me
Let my feelings flow free
I face my pain by letting go
Put trust in fate and now I always have hope
I no longer need to be alone
Cuz her head's upon my shoulder...
As she whispers in my ear...
The hurt we keep inside, it burns
And when we never speak, we learn
Our silence has more power than we realize
But when we let it out, and cry
And through tears we speak our minds
And find the words that ring true to our heart
Every day becomes better than the last
Aand to this day
I shall remember
So far away
A time I never will let go
Aand to this day
I thought I should break
Out of my shell
Thank you my beautiful filly
For showing me the way
Your words will always be with me
Thank you my dear
Fluttershy!
