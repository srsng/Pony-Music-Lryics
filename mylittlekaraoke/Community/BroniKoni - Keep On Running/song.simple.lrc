[00:09.78]One, two, three, go!
[00:16.24]It's 2 AM or so
[00:18.70]Everyone left you alone
[00:21.16]You feel so bored and annoyed
[00:26.09]Trying to relax, but you just can't sleep
[00:28.55]Crazy thoughts are buried in your mind so deep
[00:31.01]What if this is it, your life's breakpoint?
[00:35.93]Remember, while your heart is beating
[00:38.40]Whenever you feel like you're bleeding
[00:40.86]Every tragedy is overstated
[00:45.78]Don't worry, never ever be upset
[00:48.24]Take a one-way road that lies ahead
[00:50.70]Get up and run with me instead
[00:54.40]Just keep on running
[00:57.47]No matter what they say
[00:59.93]And never turn back while the wind is blowing through your mane
[01:04.24]Just keep on trotting
[01:07.32]And leave your past behind
[01:09.78]Embrace every moment, let the future be your guide
[01:14.40]Keep on running
[01:17.16]Forget that you can't fly
[01:19.63]Cause you don't need to now, you're just as free as pegasi
[01:23.93]Just keep on trotting
[01:27.01]No one can bring you down
[01:29.47]One day your hooves will take you off the ground
[01:33.78]Get up and run!
[01:38.70]Get up and run!
[01:44.24]Wow!
[01:46.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[01:49.78]So hard to find your way
[01:52.24]You fail to count your fails
[01:54.70]Everything goes wrong like you have four left feets
[01:59.63]Rewatching ponies fifty thousand times
[02:02.40]Memorizing every single line
[02:04.70]But it won't help you if you never try
[02:09.47]Inspiration never ever comes to you
[02:11.78]Imagination doesn't work, how to get through
[02:14.40]Everypony knows what I'm singing about
[02:19.32]Forget it all, just move your feets
[02:21.78]Come out and listen to this beat
[02:24.24]Carry on the melody and sing it out!
[02:27.93]Just keep on running
[02:31.01]No matter what they say
[02:33.47]And never turn back while the wind is blowing through your mane
[02:37.78]Just keep on trotting
[02:40.86]And leave your past behind
[02:43.32]Embrace every moment, let the future be your guide
[02:47.93]Keep on running
[02:50.70]Forget that you can't fly
[02:53.16]Cause you don't need to now, you're just as free as pegasi
[02:57.47]Just keep on trotting
[03:00.55]No one can bring you down
[03:03.01]One day your hooves will take you off the ground
[03:07.32]Get up and run!
[03:11.93]Get up and run!
[03:17.16]Get up and run!
[04:21.47]Keep on running
[04:24.24]No matter what they say
[04:26.70]And never turn back while the wind is blowing through your mane
[04:31.01]Just keep on trotting
[04:34.09]And leave your past behind
[04:36.55]Embrace every moment, let the future be your guide
[04:41.16]Keep on running
[04:43.93]Forget that you can't fly
[04:46.40] Cause you don't need to now, you're just as free as pegasi
[04:50.70]Just keep on trotting
[04:53.78]No one can bring you down
[04:56.24]One day your hooves will take you off the ground
[05:00.55]Get up and run!
[05:05.47]Get up and run!
[05:10.09]Get up and ru~n
[05:15.32]Get up and run, run, run, run, ru~n!
[05:20.24]Get up and run!
[05:23.63]Wow!
