All the townsfolk, they are fast asleep
Chasing mem'ries or just counting sheep
But I don't need it, I don't think so
I'm not crazy, I don't think so
Though she'll never get to dream
Who needs all that forgetting
There's a tapestry of stars
Look how thankless they are
These eyes these eyes
So heavy heavy heavy
Make time make time
I'm ready ready ready
Though she'll never get to dream
Who needs all that forgetting
There's a tapestry of stars
All the townsfolk, they say rise and shine
Chasing daylight or just killing time
Is it secret? I don't think so
Am I selfish? I don't think so
