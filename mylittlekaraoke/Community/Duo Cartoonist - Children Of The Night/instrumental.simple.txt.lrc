Come little children
I'll take thee away
Into a land
Of enchantment
Come little children
The time's come to play
Here in my garden
Of shadows
Follow sweet children
I'll show thee the way
Through all the pain
And the sorrows
Weep not poor children
For life is this way
Murdering beauty
And passions
Hush now dear children
It must be this way
To weary of life
And deceptions
Rest now my children
For soon we're away
Into the calm
And the quiet
Come little children
I'll take thee away
Into a land
Of enchantment
Come little children
The time's come to play
Here in my garden
Of shadows
