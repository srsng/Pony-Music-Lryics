Come little children
I'll take thee away
Into a land
Of enchantment
Come little children
The time's come to play
Here in my-y garden
Of sha-a-adows
Follow sweet children
I'll show thee the way
Through all the pain
And the sorrows
Weep not poor children
For life is this way
Murdering beauty
A-nd pa-a-assions
Hush now dear children
It must be this way
To weary of life
And deceptions
Rest now my children
For soon we're away
Into the calm
And the qui-i-iet
Come little children
I'll take thee away
Into a land
Of enchantment
Come little children
The time's co-ome to play
Here in my-y garden
Of sha-a-adows
