[00:09.97]Come little children
[00:12.74]I'll take thee away
[00:16.08]Into a land
[00:18.37]Of enchantment
[00:22.08]Come little children
[00:24.78]The time's come to play
[00:28.04]Here in my-y garden
[00:30.78]Of sha-a-adows
[00:38.62]Follow sweet children
[00:41.28]I'll show thee the way
[00:44.58]Through all the pain
[00:46.87]And the sorrows
[00:50.47]Weep not poor children
[00:53.35]For life is this way
[00:56.62]Murdering beauty
[00:59.24]A-nd pa-a-assions
[01:07.15]Hush now dear children
[01:09.89]It must be this way
[01:12.89]To weary of life
[01:15.44]And deceptions
[01:19.19]Rest now my children
[01:21.93]For soon we're away
[01:25.27]Into the calm
[01:27.59]And the qui-i-iet
[02:10.49]Come little children
[02:13.19]I'll take thee away
[02:16.42]Into a land
[02:18.70]Of enchantment
[02:22.38]Come little children
[02:25.19]The time's co-ome to play
[02:28.38]Here in my-y garden
[02:31.30]Of sha-a-adows
