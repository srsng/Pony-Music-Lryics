[00:18.20]She's on~ly a princess
[00:20.38]In the eyes of the world
[00:22.70]But she's~ my~ queen
[00:26.92]She's a night~ at the cir~cus
[00:29.15]Lemon ice cream swirl
[00:31.47]'Cause she's so sweet
[00:35.74]Like a field of roses~~
[00:37.97]Like a melody
[00:40.15]Sung by an angel choir
[00:44.52]I had al~ways ima~gined
[00:46.74]It was just my mind
[00:49.06]But she's no~ dream
[00:52.92]Bound as one we will stay
[00:57.38]Close beside or far away
[01:01.70]No one's ever gonna say~
[01:06.11]You and I are just a game
[01:28.42]Never wanders without me
[01:30.65]Never drops his guard
[01:33.06]And that's all right~~
[01:37.24]Says he can't live with out me
[01:39.47]Says I'm in his~ heart
[01:41.79]But he's my life~
[01:46.02]Like a reverent sol~dier
[01:48.20]Like a guardian
[01:50.42]Who's always looking out
[01:54.79]Never thought I would find him
[01:57.06]Or that he'd find~ me
[01:59.38]But now he's mine
[02:03.24]Bound as one we will stay
[02:07.61]Close beside or far away
[02:12.02]No one's ever gonna say~
[02:16.38]You and I are just a game
[02:20.79]Bound as one we will stay
[02:25.20]Close beside or far away
[02:29.56]No one's ever gonna say~
[02:33.88]You and I are just a game
[02:37.61]Just a game
