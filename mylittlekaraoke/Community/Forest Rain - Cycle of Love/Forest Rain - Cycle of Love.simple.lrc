[00:06.50][P1] There is a boy I~ love
[00:09.32][P1] I'm always thinking of
[00:12.40][P1] But his heart belo~ngs to someo~~ne else
[00:17.15][P1] And even though I've known him fo~r so long
[00:24.28][P1] I know that what I~ feel now is wrong
[00:33.35][P2] There is a girl who's mine
[00:36.17][P2] I'm with her all the time
[00:39.39][P2] And our life was always so perfect from afar
[00:44.05][P2] But late~ly she has seemed so distant from my heart
[00:51.14][P2] I think that she would rather we be apart
[00:59.59][P1] A heart is a very complex thing
[01:02.59][P1] Is it love~? Or just another fling?
[01:05.23][P1] It seems my thoughts and feelings aren't the same
[01:10.51][P1] And is it fair for me to put him through
[01:13.38][P1] Another year if this isn't true?
[01:16.54][P1] I think it's time we went our separate ways
[01:21.87][P2] I think my heart has come undone
[01:21.96][P1] When your heart is come undone
[01:24.16][P2] Like being shot by a gun
[01:24.51][P1] It is time to move on
[01:27.33][P1] And I'm sorry I hurt you
[01:27.33][P2] This is the worst that I have been
[01:29.97][P1] But this is what I must do
[01:30.24][P2] I don't know how I begin
[01:32.79][P1] To carry on
[01:32.79][P2] To carry o~n
[02:08.63][P2] I feel so alone~
[02:14.26][P1] I'm sorry I only needed some space
[02:16.33][P2] How could she not need me
[02:21.97][P2] I need to find someone~
[02:25.27][P1] Don't cry, you haven't been erased
[02:26.24][P2] Who can listen, who can see
[02:37.91][P1] Oh hi!
[02:39.76][P2] Hey, we… we broke up
[02:44.11][P1] I- I'm so sorry
[02:46.36][P2] It's okay, it was a long time coming
[02:48.34][P2] Can I… stay here tonight?
[02:50.19][P1] Ah- of course!
[03:27.13][P1] There is a boy who's mine
[03:29.95][P2] A girl who's just divine
[03:33.07][P1] And our friendship blossomed into something new
[03:33.07][P2] And our friendship blossomed into something new
[03:37.78][P2] You've been so kind-
[03:40.12][P1] Shh- I've been waiting for some time
[03:46.37][P1] And now our love can finally shine through
[03:46.37][P2] And now our love can finally shine through
[03:55.48][P1] My boy is far away
[03:58.26][P1] I miss him every day
[04:01.69][P1] But I can start to move on
[04:01.69][P2] Now we can finnally move on
