[00:12.03]All around me are familiar ponies
[00:16.84]All so cra-azy, all so cra-azy-y-y
[00:23.24]Started out with just my good intentions
[00:28.14]Getting nowhere, getting nowhe-e-ere
[00:34.59]Ponyville is filling up with la-aughter
[00:39.44]A disa-aster, a disa-aste-e-er
[00:45.84]Dunk my head into a pool of mi-irrors
[00:50.74]Getting nearer, getting neare-e-er
[00:57.49]And I find it kinda funny,
[01:00.32]I find it kinda sad
[01:03.14]The copies I created
[01:05.66]Are far more tha-an I had planned
[01:08.84]I don't know how to tell you,
[01:11.62]Don't think you'll understand
[01:14.44]When Pinkies run in numbers
[01:17.00]It's a very-y, very-y
[01:20.40]Mad world
[01:26.14]Mad wo-orld
[01:31.08]All I sought was to have fun with my-y friends
[01:35.93]Now its cra-azy, now its cra-azy-y-y
[01:42.38]Haven't got a clue, how to make amends
[01:47.19]Watch the paint dry, watch the paint dry-y-y
[01:53.59]One by one they're judged and banished ba-a-ack
[01:58.53]Pay attention, pay attentio-o-on
[02:04.93]By the end who is the real Pi-inkie?
[02:09.78]No one knows now, no one knows no-o-ow
[02:16.23]And I find it kinda funny,
[02:19.36]I find it kinda sad
[02:22.19]The copies I created,
[02:24.70]Are far more tha-an I had planned
[02:27.84]I don't know how to tell you,
[02:30.57]Don't think you'll understand
[02:33.44]When Pinkies run in numbers
[02:35.96]It's a very-y, very-y
[02:39.36]Mad world
[02:45.00]Mad wo-orld
[02:50.65]Mad world
[02:56.39]Mad world
