[00:30.11]Before I met you
[00:32.11]I was a no one, needed someone
[00:35.94]Then you came and rescued me
[00:38.78]From my reflection, introspection
[00:43.28]My mind goes blank when
[00:45.44]You draw near to me
[00:47.61]I just close my eyes and
[00:49.94]Think of happy days
[00:52.11]And all the ways you make my heart rise
[00:56.61]There's nopony else like you
[00:58.28]Can't believe you're mine
[00:59.61]Will you take me by the arm?
[01:01.28]I just can't resist your charm
[01:02.94]You just always know the words to say
[01:04.94]Always want to feel this way
[01:06.61]Heart begins to race
[01:07.94]As I wait for your embrace
[01:23.36]You pluck my heartstrings
[01:25.03]Until my heart sings
[01:26.69]Wrapped 'round your finger
[01:28.28]Just want to linger on
[01:29.94]You pluck my heartstrings
[01:31.61]Until my heart sings
[01:33.28]Wrapped 'round your finger
[01:34.94]Just want to linger on you
[01:49.78]You play me just like a drum
[01:52.94]And you just hum along and watch me
[01:56.61]Dance in circles, chance is not at work here
[02:00.94]This is fate, love
[02:03.28]When I look into your eyes
[02:06.28]I know that we were meant to be and
[02:09.94]There's a peaceful silence
[02:12.61]And the world stops spinning for us
[02:16.61]There's nopony else like you
[02:18.28]Can't believe you're mine
[02:19.61]Will you take me by the arm?
[02:21.28]I just can't resist your charm
[02:22.94]You just always know the words to say
[02:24.94]Always want to feel this way
[02:26.61]Heart begins to race
[02:27.94]As I wait for your embrace
[02:29.94]There's nopony else like you
[02:31.61]Can't believe you're mine
[02:32.94]Will you take me by the arm?
[02:34.61]I just can't resist your charm
[02:36.28]You just always know the words to say
[02:38.28]Always want to feel this way
[02:39.94]Heart begins to race
[02:41.28]As I wait for your embrace
[02:43.28]You pluck my heartstrings
[02:44.94]Until my heart sings

[02:48.28]Just want to linger on
[02:49.94]You pluck my heartstrings
[02:51.61]Until my heart sings
[02:53.28]Wrapped 'round your finger
