[00:14.63]When you're rife with devastation
[00:16.20]There's a simple explanation
[00:17.67]You're a toymaker's creation
[00:19.20]Trapped inside a crystal ball
[00:20.73]And whichever way he tilts it
[00:22.12]Know that we must be resilient
[00:23.66]We won't let them break our spirits
[00:25.19]As we sing our silly song
[00:30.34]Isn't it great to be different?
[00:33.27]Isn't it wonderful to be exactly who you are?
[00:36.27]Once you learn to start accepting yourse-e-elf
[00:39.26]You'll become a shining sta-a-ar
[00:41.84]Carrot Top, go beyond us
[00:43.16]You're a late star, time to fool us
[00:44.63]Keep your friends close, they're what drive you
[00:46.09]To the cosmos that describes you
[00:47.76]Carrot Top, go beyond us
[00:49.12]You're a late star, time to fool us
[00:50.62]Keep your friends close, they're what drive you
[00:52.08]To the cosmos that describes you
[00:54.94]May call it a crash, I call it a fly in
[00:56.89]Here to perform on this deserted island
[00:58.63]Jealous, cause I leave a pony smilin'?
[00:59.95]You need to chill, cause you know just who I am
[01:01.69]Out here, no cell phone service
[01:02.95]With a blank stare, it don't serve its purpose
[01:04.62]Not worthless, look under the surface
[01:05.91]Clear blue sea and these ponies are shirtless
[01:07.41]Clear blue sea and these ponies are shirtless
[01:09.08]I'm Trixie welcome to the show
[01:10.61]Got magic tricks so here we go
[01:12.14]We're gonna have some fun
[01:13.29]Hold on to your hats
[01:15.07]We don't care who you are anymore
[01:16.64]Just cart your things go out the door
[01:18.06]You claim that you're performing
[01:19.39]Don't make us laugh
[01:20.68]I have something mo-ore
[01:22.17]We've seen it befo-ore
[01:23.71]It's much more special
[01:25.17]We'd rather be in hell
[01:26.70]It might be the same act
[01:28.03]Be patient you'll see
[01:29.84]You can call it fake
[01:31.16]But this is real magic yeah yeah
[01:37.22]M- A- G- I- C
[01:44.71]Fate has been cruel and order unkind
[01:47.53]How could I have sent you away?
[01:50.46]The blame was my own; the punishment yours
[01:53.49]The harmony's silent toda-a-a-ay
[01:56.59]But into the stillness I'll bring you a song
[01:59.44]And I will your company keep
[02:02.37]Till your tired eyes and my lullabies
[02:05.44]Have carried you softly to sleep
[02:07.84]Sleep sleep sleep
[02:10.24]Hey Cheerilee Cheerilee
[02:11.36]I'm afraid to raise my ha-and
[02:13.24]I have something to ask you
[02:14.32]Cause I want to understa-and
[02:16.23]It's not about homework
[02:17.21]It's about one plus one is two-o
[02:19.23]Hey Cheerilee Cheerilee
[02:20.20]I think I'm in love with you
[02:25.57]Yeah I own this beat
[02:26.68]You can call me the king or the ruler
[02:28.01]Felon on bass, getting hoarse at the mic
[02:29.75]We're getting twenty percent cooler
[02:31.49]We hada great day out
[02:32.53]Calling my name like Ferris Bueller
[02:34.55]Time to wrap this up
[02:35.74]We're getting twenty percent cooler, hey!
[02:38.70]We're getting twenty percent coole-er
[02:41.73]We're getting twe-enty percent cooler, now!
[02:47.93]Human beings fascinate me being just the way they are
[02:52.18]Tell me, little pony, can you push a cart or drive a car?
[02:56.43]Lyre is my instrument, but humans strum their sweet guitar
[03:00.96]It's a mystery, anthropology!
[03:09.25]Disco-ord I'm howlin' at the moon
[03:11.27]And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
[03:13.57]Disco-ord whatever did we do
[03:15.66]To make you take our world away?
[03:18.02]Disco-ord are we your prey alone,
[03:20.05]Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
[03:22.34]Disco-ord we won't take it anymore
[03:24.36]So take your tyranny away!
[03:27.57]Why can't I mention Fluttershy and her timid loving mind,
[03:31.75]How she can be herself near animals,
[03:33.98]But shies away from her own kind?
[03:36.35]Why can't I mention Pinkie Pie?
[03:38.58]And the way she kind of acts a bit like me sometimes?
[03:43.38]You see I used to hate that I liked
[03:46.94]My-y Little Po-ony
[03:50.00]Not anymore
[03:51.60]I'm proud to be a bro-o-ony!
[03:54.39]When you're flying up there
[03:55.92]In the sky, rising high
[03:58.08]Every hue, it's like a dream
[04:00.10]Out of this world, into a new
[04:02.54]When you're soaring up there in the sky,
[04:04.60]Spread your wings, and you will see
[04:06.37]The cirrus swirl shimmering down below
[04:09.92]And you'll recognize the glow,
[04:11.77]From the Double
[04:12.64]Rainbow's tale isn't quite as nice
[04:14.59]As the story we knew of sugar and spice
[04:16.75]But a rainbow's easy once you get to know it
[04:18.91]With the help of the magic of a pegasus device
[04:25.77]Yeah. What do you know about Nightmare Night, son?
[04:29.92]Welcome Fillies and Gentlecolts there's no reason to scream
[04:31.94]Your favorite Princess is back; She's walkin' up on the scene
[04:34.10]She has been stuck on the moon, but that's no reason to fret
[04:36.29]She's not a nightmare no more, so buckle down and get set
[04:38.49]She's comin' gracin' her subjects, she ain't leavin' no choice
[04:40.72]She's gonna blow you all back with her Equestrian voice
[04:42.88]So cover all of your fears and stowe away all your fright
[04:45.10]The Lunar Princess is back; to bring the nightmares toni-ight
[04:56.70]So put do-own tha-at cello a-and grab the-e bass,
[04:59.46]Cause we're swingin'here tonight, this ain't no fancy music place.

[06:03.58]The secrets that we shared, the moments that you cared
[06:06.33]I gave you my heart and then you turned around
[06:08.91]We went streaking in the park,
[06:10.23]Skinny dipping after dark
[06:11.84]I gave you my heart and then you turned around
[06:14.55]Depressing melodies, suppressing fantasies
