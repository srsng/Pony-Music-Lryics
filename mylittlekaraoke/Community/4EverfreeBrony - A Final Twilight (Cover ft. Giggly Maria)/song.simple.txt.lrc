Na na na
Na na ah ah ah
Two years since the start of this perfect story
I don't want it to end
The bonds we've made here, extraordinary
I could never surrend'
But my royal duties are dragging me away
I can't say I'll be~ home someday
Standing on the platform
See you one last time
It's never been so hard for me to say goodbye~
I could never tell you in person
I'm not coming home
No, I'm not coming home
A darkness in the distance, a letter in fire
Bound with Celestia's seal
Signs of a struggle and I'm requiered
There's no time for tears
I'm sorry, but I need to do this alone
You~ all have been the~ best I've~ known
Standing on the platform
See you one last time
It's never been so hard for me to say goodbye~
I could never tell you in~ person
I'm not coming home
No I'm not coming home~~~
I'll never lie and I'll never give up
Laugh at the fear~ when it rises up~
Kindness to all, I'll give all I can
You~ all have made me~ the best I~ can
The best I~~ ca~~~~n
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Standing on the platform
See you one last time
It's never been so hard for me to say goodbye~
I could never tell you in person
I'm not coming home
This Twilight is ending
The night has come
The stars in the sky~ will carry me~ on
I could never tell you in person
I'm not coming home
No, I'm not coming home
