Save me, I'm drowning so deep in the darkness
I'm waiting for your touch to stop this
There's smoke blinding us with goodbyes
A-a-and I
Keep hope
'Cause this feeling's different and I know
I've staggered so long that it can't go
Alleviate me, I'll be fine
I-i-in time
Please remember that I miss you
Young and reckless, what did we do?
Broken promise, gone forever
Maybe one day we'll get better
Right by your side, that's where I'll be
In a heart beat if you ask me
Let's stay strangers like we're meant to
Oh, I wonder if you miss me too
Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
Woah-oh-oh
Please remember, don't forget me
I'll be leaving this heart empty
Burn our bridges, are you still there?
All these endless circles do nothing
And I don't know why I can't just let you go
Can we go back? Can we start again?
Because I need you
Oh, I wonder if you need me too

Find me, I'm waiting right here whe-re you left me
Still shredded and bruised, bu-ut I'm bre-eathing
Be brave for me, i-ignore their e-yes
Ju-u-ust try
We're dancers, and I've picked petals looki-ng fo-r answers
And I've received these edges from cha-nces
Indelible, but I-'ll be fi-i-i-ine
I-i-in time
Please remember that I miss you
Not ca-ri-ng is so hard to-o do
Everything we loved toge-ether
It's not the same without you there
Feels like you were just beside me
How did ti-me go by so quickly?
Now we're stra-ngers, but I miss you
Oh, I wonder if yo-ou miss me too-o-o
Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
Woah-oh-ohoh
Please remember, I still think of you and I-I-I
Tell me what does this all mean?
Are you even still there?
These circles do nothing
And remember, I've been wa-aiting
Ever since this started aching
Now we're strangers, but I need you
Oh, I wonder if you need me too
