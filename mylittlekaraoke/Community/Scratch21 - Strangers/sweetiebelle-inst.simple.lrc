[00:17.43]Save me, I'm drowning so deep in the darkness
[00:23.71]I'm waiting for your touch to stop this
[00:28.07]There's smoke blinding us with goodbyes
[00:31.89]A-a-and I
[00:34.89]Keep hope
[00:36.80] 'Cause this feeling's different and I know
[00:41.10]I've staggered so long that it can't go
[00:45.53]Alleviate me, I'll be fine
[00:49.36]I-i-in time
[00:52.36]Please remember that I miss you
[00:56.72]Young and reckless, what did we do?
[01:01.09]Broken promise, gone forever
[01:05.45]Maybe one day we'll get better
[01:09.82]Right by your side, that's where I'll be
[01:14.19]In a heart beat if you ask me
[01:18.55]Let's stay strangers like we're meant to
[01:22.92]Oh, I wonder if you miss me too
[01:44.75]Find me, I'm waiting right here whe-re you left me
[01:51.02]Still shredded and bruised, bu-ut I'm bre-eathing
[01:55.39]Be brave for me, i-ignore their e-yes
[01:59.21]Ju-u-ust try
[02:01.94]We're dancers, and I've picked petals looki-ng fo-r answers
[02:08.21]And I've received these edges from cha-nces
[02:12.85]Indelible, but I-'ll be fi-i-i-ine
[02:16.67]I-i-in time
[02:19.67]Please remember that I miss you
[02:24.04]Not ca-ri-ng is so hard to-o do
[02:28.40]Everything we loved toge-ether
[02:32.77]It's not the same without you there
[02:37.14]Feels like you were just beside me
[02:41.50]How did ti-me go by so quickly?
[02:45.87]Now we're stra-ngers, but I miss you
[02:50.23]Oh, I wonder if yo-ou miss me too-o-o
[02:56.65]Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
[03:01.01]Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
[03:05.38]Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
[03:09.81]Woah-oh-ohoh
[03:12.06]Please remember, I still think of you and I-I-I
[03:18.48]Tell me what does this all mean?
[03:22.43]Are you even still there?
[03:27.07]These circles do nothing
[03:29.39]And remember, I've been wa-aiting
[03:33.76]Ever since this started aching
[03:38.12]Now we're strangers, but I need you
[03:42.49]Oh, I wonder if you need me too
