Save me, I'm drowning so deep in the darkness
I'm waiting for your touch to stop this
There's smoke blinding us with goodbyes
Aand I
Keep hope
'Cause this feeling's different and I know
I've staggered so long that it can't go
Alleviate me, I'll be fine
Iin time
Please remember that I miss you
Young and reckless, what did we do?
Broken promise, gone forever
Maybe one day we'll get better
Right by your side, that's where I'll be
In a heart beat if you ask me
Let's stay strangers like we're meant to
Oh, I wonder if you miss me too
Woahohohoh
Woahohohoh
Woahohohoh
Woahoh
Please remember, don't forget me
I'll be leaving this heart empty
Burn our bridges, are you still there?
All these endless circles do nothing
And I don't know why I can't just let you go
Can we go back? Can we start again?
Because I need you
Oh, I wonder if you need me too
Find me, I'm waiting right here where you left me
Still shredded and bruised, but I'm breathing
Be brave for me, ignore their eyes
Just try
We're dancers, and I've picked petals looking for answers
And I've received these edges from chances
Indelible, but I'll be fine
Iin time
Please remember that I miss you
Not caring is so hard to do
Everything we loved together
It's not the same without you there
Feels like you were just beside me
How did time go by so quickly?
Now we're strangers, but I miss you
Oh, I wonder if you miss me too
Woahohohoh
Woahohohoh
Woahohohoh
Woahohohoh
Please remember, I still think of you and I
Tell me what does this all mean?
Are you even still there?
These circles do nothing
And remember, I've been waiting
Ever since this started aching
Now we're strangers, but I need you
Oh, I wonder if you need me too
