[00:17.43][P1] Save me, I'm drowning so deep in the darkness
[00:23.71][P1] I'm waiting for your touch to stop this
[00:28.07][P1] There's smoke blinding us with goodbyes
[00:31.89][P1] A-a-and I
[00:34.89][P1] Keep hope
[00:36.80][P1]  'Cause this feeling's different and I know
[00:41.10][P1] I've staggered so long that it can't go
[00:45.53][P1] Alleviate me, I'll be fine
[00:49.36][P1] I-i-in time
[00:52.36][P1] Please remember that I miss you
[00:56.72][P1] Young and reckless, what did we do?
[01:01.09][P1] Broken promise, gone forever
[01:05.45][P1] Maybe one day we'll get better
[01:09.82][P1] Right by your side, that's where I'll be
[01:14.19][P1] In a heart beat if you ask me
[01:18.55][P1] Let's stay strangers like we're meant to
[01:22.92][P1] Oh, I wonder if you miss me too
[01:44.75][P2] Find me, I'm waiting right here whe-re you left me
[01:51.02][P2] Still shredded and bruised, bu-ut I'm bre-eathing
[01:55.39][P2] Be brave for me, i-ignore their e-yes
[01:59.21][P2] Ju-u-ust try
[02:01.94][P2] We're dancers, and I've picked petals looki-ng fo-r answers
[02:08.21][P2] And I've received these edges from cha-nces
[02:12.85][P2] Indelible, but I-'ll be fi-i-i-ine
[02:16.67][P2] I-i-in time
[02:19.67][P2] Please remember that I miss you
[02:24.04][P2] Not ca-ri-ng is so hard to-o do
[02:28.40][P2] Everything we loved toge-ether
[02:32.77][P2] It's not the same without you there
[02:37.14][P2] Feels like you were just beside me
[02:41.50][P2] How did ti-me go by so quickly?
[02:45.87][P2] Now we're stra-ngers, but I miss you
[02:50.23][P2] Oh, I wonder if yo-ou miss me too-o-o
[02:56.65][P1] Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
[02:56.65][P2] Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
[03:01.01][P1] Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
[03:01.01][P2] Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
[03:05.38][P1] Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
[03:05.38][P2] Woah-oh-ohoh-ohoh
[03:09.81][P1] Woah-oh-oh
[03:09.81][P2] Woah-oh-ohoh
[03:11.93][P1] Please remember, don't forget me
[03:12.06][P2] Please remember, I still think of you and I-I-I
[03:16.29][P1] I'll be leaving this heart empty
[03:18.48][P2] Tell me what does this all mean?
[03:20.66][P1] Burn our bridges, are you still there?
[03:22.43][P2] Are you even still there?
[03:25.02][P1] All these endless circles do nothing
[03:27.07][P2] These circles do nothing
[03:29.39][P2] And remember, I've been wa-aiting
[03:29.94][P1] And I don't know why I can't just let you go
[03:33.76][P2] Ever since this started aching
[03:35.39][P1] Can we go back? Can we start again?
[03:38.12][P2] Now we're strangers, but I need you
[03:40.03][P1] Because I need you
[03:42.49][P1] Oh, I wonder if you need me too
[03:42.49][P2] Oh, I wonder if you need me too
