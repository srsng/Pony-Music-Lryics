[00:00.16]Well I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine
[00:04.32]I had a little stretch of land along the C.P. Line
[00:08.07]But times went by, and though I tried, the money wasn't there
[00:11.56]And the bankers came and took my land, and told me "fair is fair"
[00:15.61]I looked for every kind of job, the answer always no
[00:19.32]"Hire you now?," they'd always laugh, "we just let twenty go!"
[00:22.62]The government, they promised me a measly little sum
[00:26.00]But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum
[00:29.82]Then I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are~ gone
[00:34.36]I'm gonna be a pirate on the river Saskatchewan~
[00:42.50]And it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
[00:46.21]Stealing wheats and barley and all the other grains
[00:48.84]And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
[00:52.17]When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
[01:04.77]Well, you'd think the local farmers would know that I'm at large
[01:08.19]But just the other day I found an unprotected barge
[01:11.26]I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser
[01:14.56]I rammed their ship and sank it, and I stole their fertilizer
[01:17.75]A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river
[01:20.97]Farmers cross in so much fear their stomachs are a-quiver
[01:24.16]'Cause they know that Captain Tractor's hidin' in the bay
[01:27.16]I'll jump the bridge and knock 'em cold and sail off with their hay
[01:31.55]And it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
[01:35.26]Stealing wheats and barley and all the other grains
[01:37.85]And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
[01:41.22]When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
[01:53.86]Well, Mountie Bob, he chased me, he was always at my throat
[01:57.16]He followed on the shoreline, 'cause he didn't own a boat
[02:00.12]But the cutbacks were a-coming, and the Mountie lost his job
[02:03.57]So now he's sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob
[02:06.69]A swinging sword, a skull-and-bones, and pleasant company
[02:09.84]I never pay my income tax and screw the G.S.T.
[02:13.21]Sailin' down the Saskatoon, the terror of the sea
[02:15.95]If y'all wanna reach the Co-op, boy, you gotta get by me!
[02:19.85]Ah ah!
[02:20.64]It's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
[02:24.24]Stealing wheats and barley and all the other grains
[02:26.90]And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
[02:30.24]When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
[02:42.84]Well the pirate life's appealing but you don't just find it here
[02:46.21]I hear in north Alberta there's a band of buccaneers
[02:49.36]They roam the Athabasca from Smith to Fort McKay
[02:52.47]And you're gonna lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way
[02:55.74]Well, winter is a-coming and a chill is in the breeze
[02:58.89]My pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze
[03:02.07]But I'll be back in springtime, but now I have to go
[03:05.22]I hear there's lots of plundering down in New Mexico
[03:09.61]And it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
[03:13.32]Stealing wheats and barley and all the other grains
[03:15.91]And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
[03:19.25]When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
[03:22.29]And it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
[03:26.00]Stealing wheats and barley and all the other grains
[03:28.59]And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
[03:31.92]When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
[03:38.04]And it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
[03:41.71]Stealing wheats and barley and all the other grains
[03:44.41]And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
[03:47.71]When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
[03:50.90]When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
