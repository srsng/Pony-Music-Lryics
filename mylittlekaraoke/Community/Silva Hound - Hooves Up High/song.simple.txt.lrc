Sit back and smile~ not worth the fight~
So just re~member that it's all alright
Though it seems dark on this cold black night~
The sun has~ set let's bring it back to life
I'm~ gonna put my hooves up high
Don't worry about tomorrow 'cause I'm here tonight
I'll grab the world before it passes by~
Don't worry about tomorrow 'cause I'm here tonight
I'm~ gonna put my hooves up high
Don't worry about tomorrow 'cause I'm here tonight
I'll grab the world before it passes by~
Don't worry about tomorrow 'cause I'm here tonight
Go go go go go go go go
Go go go go go go go go
Go go go go go go go go go go go go
Sit back and smile~ not worth the fight~
So just re~member that it's all alright
Though it seems dark on this cold black night~
The sun has set let's bring it back to life
I'm~ gonna put my hooves up high
Don't worry about tomorrow 'cause I'm here tonight
I'll grab the world before it passes by~
Don't worry about tomorrow 'cause I'm here tonight
I'm~ gonna put my hooves up high
Don't worry about tomorrow 'cause I'm here tonight
I'll grab the world before it passes by~
Don't worry about tomorrow 'cause I'm here tonight
I'm~ gonna put my hooves up high
Don't worry about tomorrow 'cause I'm here tonight
I'll grab the world before it passes by~~~
Don't worry about tomorrow 'cause I'm here tonight
