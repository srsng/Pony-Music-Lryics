Why you put me through this
I'll never know~~
But you continually
Strain me and erode my will
Silenced and seemingly calm
I'm no reflect of my inner storm
You seek me out and
Stay ambiguous
What do you want from me?~
Why do you play with me?
Destroying me
Guilt-tripping me~
You show your body to me
You speak of feelings
That are never to be~~
You force your way
Into my thoughts~~
I never knew before
That apples could have thorns~~
And whilst you condemn me to a
Life of misery~
Behind your prison bars I've
Never felt so free
