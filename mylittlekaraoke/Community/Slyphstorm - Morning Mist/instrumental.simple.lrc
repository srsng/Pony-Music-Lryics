[00:49.21]A thousand years, past again
[00:52.18]It seemed so much shorter this time
[00:55.39]I look back, now and then
[00:58.20]It's always been an uphill climb
[01:00.95]All I can see is sunlight
[01:04.17]As the solar power courses through my being
[01:06.98]All I can feel is shadow
[01:10.19]As my broken heart grows colder and colder and
[01:13.00]All I see through the darkness
[01:16.18]Is the face of someone gone to me forever
[01:18.99]All that I think of in the night~
[01:23.14]Is the memories that we share and
[01:25.02]All that I know is that
[01:27.67]tomorrow always stands
[01:29.20]But I don't always know when and
[01:30.95]Through the morning mist~
[01:35.16]The sun will rise again
[01:37.41]As I lay down to sleep at night
[01:40.72]I hear her whisper to me
[01:43.43]"Hush~ now, rest your head"
[01:46.46]"Off to sleep with thee..."
[01:48.93]Tough times and lonely hallways
[01:52.46]Haunt ev'ry minute of my being
[01:54.98]Long lost names fade to black~
[01:58.48]But they will never be forgotten
[02:04.00]All I see through the darkness
[02:07.19]Is the face of someone gone to me forever
[02:10.00]All that I think of in the night~
[02:14.15]Is the memories that we share and
[02:16.02]All that I know is that
[02:18.68]tomorrow always stands
[02:20.21]But I don't always know when and
[02:21.95]Through the morning mist~
[02:26.17]The sun will rise again
[03:16.02]All I see through the darkness
[03:19.20]Is the face of someone gone to me forever
[03:22.01]All that I think of in the night~
[03:26.16]Is the memories that we share and
[03:28.04]All that I know is that
[03:30.69]tomorrow always stands
[03:32.22]But I don't always know when and
[03:33.97]Through the morning mist~
[03:38.18]The sun will rise again
