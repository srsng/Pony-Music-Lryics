[00:18.93]People say real fashion
[00:22.99]Was a fossil dead~ and gone
[00:26.88]Saw your work and it’s safe~ to say that you’ve proved~ them~ wrong
[00:34.93]Stitching fit for a prin~cess gown
[00:38.89]Suits that turn the world upside~ down~
[00:42.94]Don’t suppose you’ve had customers with my spi~ky crown?
[00:50.49]You~ started working, and when you were~ through~~
[00:58.51]Now~ I’m just~ one more boy
[01:01.94]In your mile~ long crush queue
[01:06.46]Hey~ Hey Ms. Rarity I know you
[01:10.95]Don’t exactly have time for~ me
[01:13.73]But if the fate’s let us make contact
[01:17.75]I’ll be your A- List date just like all of your contracts~
[01:22.99]Maybe hold your hoof after dinner
[01:26.17]You’ll smile~ back at me and then,
[01:29.97]Dilettantes would all talk
[01:32.19]The crème de la crème would all tell~~
[01:35.96]That I’m out with Ms. Rarity Belle
[01:46.91]Someday, if you’re in town
[01:50.96]We’ll hit up, Flim and Flam’s fairgrounds~
[01:54.74]The days of summer would fly~ by as we just bummed around
[02:02.97]Laughing at stupid inside jokes
[02:06.96]Maybe walking too slow or too close
[02:10.73]And if your sister sees us there under Star~swirl’s Oaks
[02:17.69]She’ll say~ "My~ sister thinks she’s parked your tail and~ locked it,
[02:26.42]Dontcha think about~ running off, with her heart in your pocket~"
[02:34.47]Hey~ hey there Sweetie Belle, I promise
[02:38.93]When we’re out I’m nervous as hell
[02:41.89]She’s so down to earth and charming
[02:45.97]Does she know she’s world famous? It’s kinda disarming~
[02:50.93]I’ll stay with her as long as I can but, compared~ to Manehattan’s screen gems
[02:57.89]She’s more likely to be getting tired~ of me, but till then~~
[03:03.69]I’m still cra~zy ‘bout Rarity
[03:06.46]Her and me
[03:08.18]Just fit you see
[03:10.18]When she lets me in to the deep blue sea
[03:14.20]Of her eyes, it’s paralyzing
[03:18.22]I physically can’t leave her
[03:21.81]And at the risk of being called a dreamer…
[03:28.45]Hey~ Hey Ms. Rarity you know you’ll
[03:32.94]Never have to perform for~ me, if you’re feeling beat and tired
[03:39.93]From a long day of stitching, you’ll still be admired~
[03:45.01]Even if it’s just pizza and Runway I’ll tell all my friends go ahead
[03:51.72]Mah gals tired, well you’ll say you’re fine, but my jobs for tonight are set
[03:59.76]And that’s chef and duvet. Don’t care if my boys give me hell
[04:05.72]I’m hanging in with my Ra~rity Belle~~
