[00:51.49]Ancient tale
[00:53.11]That you all fear~
[00:55.19]Shall unveil
[00:56.70]As the full moon shall appear
[00:58.96]Over the night sky her voice had rised
[01:02.55]Slender and gentle still
[01:06.31]Now that she's summoning all despised
[01:09.90]Shall our dreams fulfill?
[01:13.67]I shall cast my spell on you
[01:20.96]Summon you under my silk-linen banners
[01:28.44]Come, little children, my minions, be true
[01:35.91]And I'll reward you
[01:39.56]After my manner
[01:42.68]Full moon, the legend's been true
[01:45.69]It hangs in the sky
[01:50.15]Full moon is calling for you
[01:53.22]Won't you reply?
[01:57.51]Full moon, the legend's been true
[02:00.52]It hangs in the sky
[02:04.92]Full moon is calling for you
[02:08.05]Won't you reply?
[02:27.51]Wings of a bat and these amber eyes
[02:31.22]Somehow we had to pay
[02:34.75]For rushing in thunder through moonlit skies
[02:38.57]Riding the hurricane!
[02:42.22]You, once common pegasi
[02:49.69]Shall be the soldiers
[02:53.11]Of my nocturne army
[02:57.05]Cast now aside all your fears~ and fly
[03:04.17]Preceding the tidal wave my midnight's bringing on them
[03:11.81]Who will regret
[03:15.00]What we must leave behind
[03:18.76]And forget and forsake what we loved
[03:22.41]To become ones who ever will trail her the way?
[03:27.34]The legend's been true
[03:29.19]It hangs in the sky
[03:33.47]Full moon is calling for you
[03:36.72]Won't you reply?
[03:40.89]Full moon, the legend's been true
[03:43.96]It hangs in the sky
[03:48.30]Full moon is calling for you
[03:51.49]Won't you reply?
