[00:51.79]Ancient tale
[00:53.41]That you all fear~
[00:55.50]Shall unveil
[00:57.00]As the full moon shall appear
[00:59.26]Over the night sky her voice had rised
[01:02.85]Slender and gentle still
[01:06.62]Now that she's summoning all despised
[01:10.21]Shall our dreams fulfill?
[01:13.97]I shall cast my spell on you
[01:21.27]Summon you under my silk-linen banners
[01:28.74]Come, little children, my minions, be true
[01:36.21]And I'll reward you
[01:39.86]After my manner
[01:42.99]Full moon, the legend's been true
[01:46.00]It hangs in the sky
[01:50.46]Full moon is calling for you
[01:53.53]Won't you reply?
[01:57.81]Full moon, the legend's been true
[02:00.82]It hangs in the sky
[02:05.23]Full moon is calling for you
[02:08.35]Won't you reply?
[02:27.81]Wings of a bat and these amber eyes
[02:31.52]Somehow we had to pay
[02:35.05]For rushing in thunder through moonlit skies
[02:38.87]Riding the hurricane!
[02:42.52]You, once common pegasi
[02:49.99]Shall be the soldiers
[02:53.41]Of my nocturne army
[02:57.35]Cast now aside all your fears~ and fly
[03:04.47]Preceding the tidal wave my midnight's bringing on them
[03:12.12]Who will regret
[03:15.30]What we must leave behind
[03:19.07]And forget and forsake what we loved
[03:22.72]To become ones who ever will trail her the way?
[03:27.64]The legend's been true
[03:29.49]It hangs in the sky
[03:33.78]Full moon is calling for you
[03:37.02]Won't you reply?
[03:41.19]Full moon, the legend's been true
[03:44.26]It hangs in the sky
[03:48.60]Full moon is calling for you
[03:51.79]Won't you reply?
