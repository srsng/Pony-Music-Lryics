You think you know what you are saying
That there's magic in the words you speak
Say what you want, you're just pretending
You're nothing but this fake mystique
And it surrounds you
This air of pride
You'll never see through
Your own little lies
You forced me
To reform~
But I am never turning back
I am Tempest
Of the storm~
Ever poised and ready to attack
