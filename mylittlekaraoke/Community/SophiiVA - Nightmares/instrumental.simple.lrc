[00:02.78]My dreams are built upon an oasis of my guilt
[00:11.14]Blackened stars above reveal the shame I’ve built
[00:19.00]How do I find the light that'll break me from its grasp~
[00:26.02]Sleep O~ troubled ones
[00:32.26]And let the nightmares pass
[00:43.01]Hide yourself, from~ the darkness
[00:47.79]The night is growing darker within
[00:50.76]Our dreams connected, by~ a thread of
[00:55.73]My magic, don’t let fear give in
[00:58.54]To the mons~ters~~ hiding underneath~ your bed~
[01:04.79]Oh~ oh~
[01:06.75]Your silent aches are mine to take~
[01:11.72]Just close your eyes and gently fall to sleep
[01:15.08]O~~ troubled~ ones~~~~~
[01:21.09]Gently fall asleep
[01:23.05]O~~ troubled~ ones~~~~
[01:39.05]Chasing after power, searching for an answer
[01:43.71]Let no pony fear me again~
[01:47.02]I will soar up~, gleaming brighter than the moonlight
[01:52.84]Oh~ oh~
[01:54.77]With friends around me no dream can stop~ me
[01:59.74]Now close your eyes and gently fall asleep
[02:03.02]O~ troubled~ ones~~~~~
[02:09.07]Gently fall to sleep
[02:11.11]O~~ troubled~ ones~~~~~
[02:16.54]Let your nightmares pass
[02:19.09]Blinded by~ my selfish desires~
[02:27.06]All I ever wanted was~~ love~~
[02:34.77]But now, we’ve won the fight
[02:38.01]Heads up high, past the sha~dows
[02:43.02]I am the princess of the night~
[02:48.76]And I’ll be there for you
[02:51.15]O troubled ones~~~~
[02:57.09]Close your eyes and sleep
[02:59.01]O~~ troubled~ ones
[03:04.87]Til’ morning you will wake
[03:07.11]O~~ troubled~ ones~~~~
[03:13.08]Gently fall to sleep
[03:15.08]O~~ troubled~ ones
[03:20.59]Let your nightmares pass
[03:30.81]My dreams were lost in an oasis of my~ guilt
[03:38.78]The shining stars above proclaim the love we’ve built
[03:46.80]The evening passes by, the morning is nigh
[03:53.54]As the rays of sun begin to seep
[04:01.48]As I close my eyes and go to sleep
