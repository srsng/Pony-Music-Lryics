[00:07.44]The night is getting darker
[00:09.29]And the full moon is in the sky
[00:11.73]In the distance you hear a howl
[00:13.45]And a blood-curdling cry
[00:15.60]You think it's probably just the wind
[00:17.68]But then something else happens
[00:19.58]Something that makes you think again
[00:22.44]There's something moving
[00:23.81]Out through the night
[00:25.36]You got that sickly sinking feeling
[00:27.50]That something isn't right
[00:29.52]You run to find a shelter
[00:31.55]Locking the door
[00:33.15]But behind you there's a shadow
[00:35.36]Crawling 'cross the floor
[00:37.98]You turn to scream
[00:40.12]It seems a little mean
[00:41.67]Knees are shaking, cold sweat
[00:43.63]And your hearts are racing
[00:45.54]Those claws, those teeth
[00:47.68]Who's that underneath?
[00:49.17]Is that a hedgehog?
[00:50.54]Your eyes can't believe
[00:52.14]He's been wolf-i-fied!
[00:54.88]You better fly
[00:56.07]Cause there's no one here to save you
[00:58.21]And you can not deny
[00:59.82]He's been wolf-i-fied!
[01:02.44]Just say goodbye
[01:03.57]Cause there's no place left to run to
[01:05.77]There's no place left to hi-ide
[01:08.21]You think you made it
[01:09.52]Running out the back
[01:11.25]But you better think again
[01:12.98]Because something's on your track
[01:15.36]You run into a corner
[01:17.26]Turn to see who's there
[01:18.87]Now there's almost half a dozen
[01:20.89]That seems a bit unfair!
[01:23.63]You turn to scream
[01:25.95]Get something in between
[01:27.32]Knees are shaking, cold sweat
[01:29.35]And your hearts are racing
[01:31.25]Those claws, those teeth
[01:33.15]Who's that underneath?
[01:34.82]Are those your friends there?
[01:36.25]Your eyes can't believe
[01:37.92]They've been wolf-i-fied!
[01:40.54]No need to try
[01:41.73]Cause there's no one here to save you
[01:43.87]And you can not deny
[01:45.54]We've been wolf-i-fied!
[01:48.15]Just say goodbye
[01:49.35]Cause there's no place left to run to
[01:51.49]There's no place left to hi-ide
[01:53.63]Wolf-i, wolf-i-fied!
[01:57.44]Wolf-i, wolf-i-fied!
[02:01.25]Wolf-i, wolf-i-fied!
[02:05.06]Wolf-i, wolf-i-fied!
