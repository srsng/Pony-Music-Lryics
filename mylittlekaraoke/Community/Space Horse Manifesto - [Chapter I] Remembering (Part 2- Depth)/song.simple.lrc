[00:47.99]Three minutes and dawn will arise~ again~
[00:51.96]Three minutes and a blessing will shine~ on me
[00:55.93]Filling me with song and wisdom and joy
[00:58.69]'Cause I'll stay close~ to you
[01:00.64]Without fear~ that you might forget~~
[01:11.08]Oasis in my eyes~, an an~chor kee~ping~ me sane
[01:15.58]"And you'll prove to me that I am made to be loved~"
[01:19.60]I pray this story won't be ending in pain
[01:22.46]'Cause I can't reach for you my dear
[01:24.72]As these~ wings are stuck here~~
[01:43.59]Warm~ breeze after warm~ breeze I try
[01:47.53]And seize one of all these moments slipping by~~
[01:58.90]Seizing us before you'll fade~ into me~mories
[02:02.96]Saving you before I'll fade into my dreams
[02:07.15]And as your Angel, I~ know
[02:10.12]This holy river will fore~ver flow~~
[02:16.32]Hold on, my dear
[02:18.02]Cause I will run, run, run to save you in the mor~ningâ€”
[02:22.55]Oasis in my eyes~, an an~chor keep~ing~ me sane
[02:26.98]"And you'll prove to me that I am made to be loved~"
[02:31.01]I pray this story won't be ending in pain
[02:33.86]'Cause I won't reach for you my dear
[02:36.15]As these~ wings are stuck here~~
