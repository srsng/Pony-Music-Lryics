[00:15.87]They took me out of my house
[00:17.80]Now I have~ a new~ home
[00:23.61]I gobble pills like a good girl
[00:25.78]And I get a new~ bone~~~~
[00:46.83]I wiggle around my fake tail despite how they treat me
[00:50.70]They make me feel so alone~ even when they're here
[00:54.57]So many orders to tell me
[00:56.99]I dunno what to do~
[01:02.32]I wanna run on all fours
[01:04.25]Just like anyone around~ me~~~~
[01:10.06]So I run after my friends
[01:11.99]But my friends wanna catch~~~ me ~
[01:17.80]I'm not like anyone else
[01:19.74]Cause they just wanna hurt~ me~
[01:22.40] stop me and torture me~ but that's alright~
[01:25.78]Cause I know who I am
[01:27.48]But still no one believes~ me~
[01:32.56] believes~ me~,
[01:36.43] believes~~ me~~~~~
[01:48.77]Now I see everyone else
[01:50.70]From a small win~dow
[01:56.51]They all seem so normal
[01:58.69]It feels really~ shal~low~~
[02:04.25]So I wondered why everyone were against~ me~
[02:08.12]I thought that it's normal to~ be who I want to be~
[02:11.99]And they all call me crazy
[02:14.17] but I just wished to be free~~~~~~
[02:19.74]I wanna run on all fours
[02:21.67]Just like anyone around~ me~~~~
[02:27.48]So I run after my friends
[02:29.41]But my friends wanna catch~~~ me~
[02:35.22]I'm not like anyone else
[02:37.16]Cause they just wanna hurt~ me~
[02:39.82] stop me and torture me~ but that's alright~
[02:43.20]Cause I know who I am
[02:44.90]But still no one believes~ me~
[02:49.98] believes~ me~
[02:53.85] believes~~ me~~~~~~~~~~~
[03:07.88]Wah~~oh~~~
[03:29.41]I'm not like anyone else
[03:31.35]Cause they just wanna hurt~ me~
[03:34.01] stop me and torture me~ that's alright
