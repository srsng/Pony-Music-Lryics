I was headed
To east Texas
On a business trip
I had a room
At the Holiday Iinn Express
I dragged my bag
To the elevator
But the button
For my floor was already pressed
The door slid open
Then I felt
Out of place
I can only imagine
The look on my face
It was one of those
"Everybody dress like ponies
Do drugs and rub on each other"
Kinda parties that folks like me
Will never understand
It's kinda weird
Seeing a grownass man
In a costume, magenta hair
Plastic eyes looking at you
On an elevator
With a pink brush in his hand
Tonight everybody's dressed
Like ponies at the Holiday Inn
And I don't think I'm coming back
To this town again
Maybe Tom Bodett has a rom
That I can stay in?
Because everybody's
Dressed like ponies at this Holiday Inn
This place is weird
I gotta go
This one or the dang continental breakfast
I gotta deal with this mess
