[00:04.22]I was headed
[00:06.24]To east Texas
[00:08.34]On a business trip
[00:12.32]I had a room
[00:14.45]At the Holiday I-inn Express
[00:20.64]I dra-agged my ba-a-ag
[00:24.43]To the elevator
[00:28.37]But the button
[00:30.32]For my floor was already pre-essed
[00:36.80]The door slid open
[00:40.52]Then I felt
[00:42.65]Out of place
[00:44.75]I can only imagine
[00:48.95]The look on my fa-a-ace
[00:55.59]It was one of those
[00:56.94]"Everybody dress like ponies
[00:59.04]Do drugs and ru-ub on each other"
[01:01.63]Kinda parties that folks like me-e
[01:05.15]Will never understand
[01:09.47]It's kinda we-ird
[01:11.00]Seeing a grown-ass man
[01:12.80]In a costume, magenta hair
[01:15.24]Plastic eyes looking at you
[01:17.49]On an elevator
[01:18.92]With a pink brush in his hand
[01:23.94]Toni-ight everybody's dressed
[01:25.97]Like po-onies at the Holiday Inn
[01:30.88]And I do-on't think I'm coming back
[01:33.73]To thi-is town again
[01:37.93]Maybe To-om Bodett has a ro-om
[01:41.08]That I can stay i-in?
[01:45.32]Beca-use everybody's
[01:47.12]Dressed li-ike ponies at this Holida-ay Inn
[01:53.64]This place is weird
[01:54.58]I gotta go
[01:56.75]This one or the dang continental breakfast
[01:58.52]I gotta deal with this mess
