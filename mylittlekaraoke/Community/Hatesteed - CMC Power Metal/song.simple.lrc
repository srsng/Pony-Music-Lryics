[00:15.87]Listen up 'cause here's our story
[00:19.04]I'm gonna sing it very loud~~
[00:29.61]When you're a younger po~ny
[00:32.91]And your flank is very bare~

[01:20.92]When the time is really right~
[01:24.38]And you know just what you're supposed~ to do
[01:27.87]And your talent comes to light~
[01:31.09]But it's not as easy as it sounds~
[01:34.66]And that waiting's hard to~ do~
[01:38.00]So we test our talents eve~rywhere
[01:41.57]Until our face~ turns blue~
