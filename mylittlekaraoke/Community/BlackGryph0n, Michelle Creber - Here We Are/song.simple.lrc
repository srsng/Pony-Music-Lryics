[00:17.85]You could be a light in the dead of the night
[00:21.13]Instead of searching for the light yourself
[00:24.40]Reflecting on the moments you~ lost
[00:27.33]The moments you thought
[00:29.20]Would finally be~ the e~~nd
[00:32.82]Searching for the li~ght in the dead of the night
[00:36.22]When I could light the way for someone else
[00:39.49]Forgetting all the moments I~ lost
[00:42.30]The more that I~ thought
[00:44.17]I'd never see~ the e~~nd
[00:47.45]And now the timing is right
[00:49.55]Stepping into the light
[00:51.19]You've finally found a way to be yourse~lf
[00:54.47]I realize that I needed this road
[00:57.27]I needed to~ know
[00:59.14]I'd find it i~n the e~~nd
[01:03.12]Whoa-oh-oh
[01:10.49]Whoa-oh
[01:16.93]So here we are!
[01:18.56]I was starting to~ believe that we would never get this fa~r
[01:24.41]But here we are!
[01:26.05]There's no turning back now, we're further than the sta~~rs
[01:31.90]And here we are!
[01:33.54]After searching a~ll those years, we've finally found our destiny~
[01:39.39]So here we are!
[01:41.02]And we'll make a~ ne~w mark by helping others see~
[01:45.70]See who they really want to be!
[02:10.62]Time moves fast if you're too busy to watch it go
[02:17.87]But I remember the years by realizing all we didn't know
[02:25.59]These young eyes looking all around for something bigger than we could see
[02:33.32]But no doubt could ever slow us down
[02:36.59]Drawn by the promise of eventually
[02:39.87]And now the timing is right
[02:41.97]Stepping into the light
[02:43.61]You've finally found a way to be yourse~lf
[02:46.88]I realize that I needed this road
[02:49.69]I needed to~ know
[02:51.68]I'd find it i~n the e~~nd
[02:55.54]Whoa-oh-oh
