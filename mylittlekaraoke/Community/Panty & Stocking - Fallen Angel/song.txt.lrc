Heaven, please sing for me a song of life
Heaven, take me into your skies
There's no place here for me to hide my cries
Night and day, I'm mis~sing you ooh~
So close, so close
And it's you that I believe in, I believe in
So~ close
But far away so far I can't touch
I'll hold~ on
Cuz it's you I love so dearly
When the rain, the storm, and all is done
Caress me with your sweet lullaby
