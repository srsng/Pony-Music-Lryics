[00:49.62]I find it funny that you know
[00:52.38]You've got a long long way to go
[00:54.96]Before you're perfectly set up
[00:57.62] To be the talk of the town
[01:00.38]'Cuz if you count up all you've got
[01:03.12]You'll notice that you've got a lot
[01:05.96]When you're so high up
[01:07.62] it takes some time to bring you on
[01:10.62]Do-own, down to where you can smell
[01:14.79] the sweet bread bake
[01:19.67]It takes some ti-ime to bring you on down
[01:25.00]to where the memo-ories awa-a-ait
[01:32.62]You just gotta walk that path again
[01:35.00]and you can smi-i-le smi-le smile
[01:38.00]You can hear the laughte-er of your friends
[01:40.54]And you can jo-oin in all the while
[01:43.33]Even when you feel alone
[01:45.79]And even if that may be so
[01:48.67]You've just gotta walk that path again
[01:51.00]And you can smi-i-le smi-le smile
[01:59.00]No matter if you're underwing
[02:01.62]Like racing or the finer things
[02:04.42]It's plain to see that we can all agree
[02:07.79] to lend out our love
[02:09.92]And if you keep yourself on track
[02:12.54]Then you'll get twice as much love back
[02:15.33]And the twiching tail will then assail us all from
[02:19.33]Abo-ove you where the
[02:22.38]Hurtful and the hateful cannot fly
[02:28.33]It's coming in from abo-ove in the cerulean
[02:34.33]And welcoming sky-y-y
[02:41.92]You just gotta walk that path again
[02:44.33]And you can smi-i-le smi-le smile
[02:47.29]You can hear the laughter of yo-ur friends
[02:49.88]And you can jo-oin in all the while
[02:52.62]Even when you feel alone
[02:55.25]Even if that may be so
[02:57.96]You've just gotta walk that path again
[03:00.33]And you can smi-i-le smi-le smile
[03:24.58]You just gotta walk that path again
[03:27.00]And you can smi-i-le smi-le smile
[03:30.00]You can hear the laughter of yo-ur friends
[03:32.50]And you can jo-oin in all the while
[03:35.29]Even when you feel alone
[03:37.83]And even if that may be so
[03:40.62]You've just gotta walk that path again
[03:43.00]And you can smi-i-le smi-le smile
