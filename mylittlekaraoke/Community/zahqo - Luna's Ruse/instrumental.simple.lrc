[00:25.08]Beyond the fields of grass~
[00:29.25]She left her tattered past~
[00:33.43]Fell into a tangled heap~
[00:37.60]Skyward all her thoughts did leap~
[00:41.51]Celestia~ didn't shine today~
[00:45.95]All our skies are dark and grey~
[00:49.86]She wonders how she lost her way~
[00:54.04]But now there is no way~ left to lose
[01:48.56]Out past~ the setting sun~~
[01:52.73]Way out where~ the moon~ becomes~~
[01:56.65]An ancient dream~ of stars divine
[02:00.82]Imprisoned her by~ their design~
[02:04.99]What force hid~ the warmth that flowed
[02:09.43]Chilled her step on every road
[02:13.60]Though these are~ the seeds she sowed~
[02:17.78]Can she find her way back? Luna's ruse~
[03:28.73]Way out~ here~
[03:32.65]I rest a dreamless sleep
[03:37.08]In the walls
[03:40.99]Compressed that I can't pass
[03:45.43]Feeling lost~
[03:49.34]It glows a beacon distant
[03:53.78]In my~ shrouded throes
[03:59.78]I'm not existant
[04:17.78]Luna's ruse~
[04:26.12]Luna's ruse~
[04:34.47]Luna's ruse~
[04:42.82]Luna's ruse~
[04:50.12]Oh Luna's ruse~
[04:59.51]Luna's ruse~
