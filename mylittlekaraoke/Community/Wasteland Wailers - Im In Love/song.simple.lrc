[00:31.59]There she goes~, up the road
[00:34.57]I'd take a chance~ if I was bold
[00:39.04]Tell the truth, her heart is gold
[00:41.70]I'm in love~
[00:45.67]Maybe she'd be doing chores
[00:49.26]Mending fences, squeaky doors
[00:53.18]Bakin pies and washin floors
[00:55.89]I'm in love~
[00:59.92]If there's trouble or commotion
[01:03.34]That's when her plan goes into motion
[01:07.04]I'm just waitin for a sign
[01:10.69]To tell her that she's mighty fine~
[01:13.45]And with a little bit of luck
[01:15.16]And a little bit of time
[01:16.98]That sweet little girl's~ gonna be all~ mine
[01:20.68]With those perfect freckles and those big green eyes
[01:24.11]I'm in love~
[01:42.33]If I could, and if she'd have it I'd
[01:45.86]Turn this longing into habit
[01:49.40]I bet that it'd cause a stir
[01:52.77]If I could shout out I'm with her
[01:56.19]My friends say man,~ you're out of your league
[01:59.34]But she's everything that I need her to be
[02:03.31]They might be right, but speaking honestly
[02:06.41]I'm in love~
[02:10.33]She's savin' the world, I'm savin' my pennies
[02:13.70]Got everything she needs and I don't have any~
[02:17.40]Way~ to try to show her~ it's alright~~
[02:21.37]I really think she's out of sight
[02:24.57]Do do do do do do do do
[02:27.94]Do do do do do do do do
[02:31.92]Hey hey hey hey hey
[02:34.18]I'm~ in love~
[02:38.77]Do do do do do do do do
[02:42.14]Do do do do do do do do
[02:46.06]Hey hey hey hey hey
[02:48.26]I'm~ in love~
