[00:01.90]This all seems very unfair
[00:04.75]How come~ everypony else has theirs?
[00:08.25]I'd be lying if I said I could wait
[00:10.65]Because I really want mine right now
[00:14.65]It kind of hurts when everypony stares
[00:17.50]To look at my flank and see there's nothing there
[00:21.10]I'm not gonna sit down and cry
[00:23.80]But sometimes it's just too~ much
[00:27.20]I have tried so very hard
[00:29.85]To find a place where I belong~~
[00:33.50]But instead of making peace with myself
[00:36.60]I sing a little song
[00:39.95]Ha na na na na na na na
[00:43.00]Na na na na na na ah na na na na na
[00:46.95]Na na na na na na na
[00:49.45]Na na na na na na ooh ooh ooh ooh
[00:59.35]So I wake up everyday
[01:02.35]Hoping that nopony else will say
[01:06.00]Hey blank flank
[01:07.25]How does it feel to not be special at all?
[01:11.95]Truth be told I'd rather hide
[01:15.10]Cover my face so we can't meet eye to eye
[01:18.80]Big sister always drags me out
[01:21.05]And says I really shouldn't think like that
[01:24.60]You can't rush things like this sugarcube~
[01:27.90]A Cutie Mark comes with time~~
[01:31.05]I know it's not something you wanna hear
[01:34.20]But how'd you think I got mine?
[01:37.40]You'll find that special talent
[01:40.05]That will make you realize~~
[01:44.00]Why you rushed things all before
[01:46.75]Besides~~
[01:50.30]One day it will come~
[01:52.85]And it's gonna make you giggle
[01:54.95]It's gonna make you smile~
[01:56.55]The kind of one that's beautiful
[01:58.30]And goes for miles~
[01:59.95]Think about it every day
[02:02.45]But you've gotta wait until then my dear
[02:05.00]Even if it takes a year
[02:06.35]I know where you're getting at sister
[02:09.45]But the thought to me is torture
[02:12.65]Gotta find a bet~ter way
[02:15.00]To get my mark much faster
[02:17.20]So I can finally stay
[02:32.00]On this journey and quest of mine
[02:34.65]I'll find a way to get it with much less time
[02:38.40]What do I do and where do I start
[02:41.05]On my journey to discover my Cutie Mark?
[02:44.60]If time is money and pain is gain
[02:47.50]Then I will endure these silly games
[02:51.15]Either way I'll discover my mark
[02:53.95]Today
[03:00.80]Ha na na na na na na na
[03:03.70]Na na na na na na ah na na na na na
[03:07.80]Na na na na na na na
[03:10.20]Na na na na na na ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
