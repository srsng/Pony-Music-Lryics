[01:50.53]You are too far gone to come around
[01:58.25]Your world is coming down~~~
[02:03.35]All things falling, and you're calling out
[02:11.28]Wishing you had listened to me now
[02:15.90]Equality, identical
[02:19.12]We all are the same, and best of all
[02:22.20]You're still below~~ me
[02:29.50]So welcome to a brave new world
[02:32.70]Two lines on a flag, and now
[02:35.02]You're turning toward me

[02:59.32]Left out every track, done with looking back
[03:00.85]Saw through every scam
[03:01.62]Outran the program
[03:02.45]Took in every wham
[03:03.25]Still took the marks back
[03:04.02]My Starlight refuses to scram
