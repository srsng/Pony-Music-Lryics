[00:44.52]Everyone sees me walking on a-a pa-ath
[00:47.52]Though my path seems to be crooked
[00:51.85]It looks like everybody thinks I'm special
[00:55.14]I thi-ink it's wrong and stupid
[00:59.26]They chose me and placed me-e really hi-igh
[01:02.40]and say that I am destined - I-I'm not
[01:06.73]And their eyes seems to a-all be fixed on me-e
[01:09.67]Why can't I really see-e it
[01:14.06]Ever since I became different
[01:16.14]I've started to hate the path I never chose-en
[01:21.44]But ever since I was little
[01:23.52]I sometimes wished that I could fly
[01:26.06]really high - so why?
[01:28.83]That ever since I got wings
[01:30.67] I've started to feel bad - that still doesn't make sense
[01:36.21]But then I re-ealized
[01:38.06] that's because I am so far away - from my friends
[02:13.14]What if I could act li-ike nothing happened
[02:16.37]Ignore the fact that I changed - I can't
[02:20.75]What if I could perform a magic spell
[02:23.52]and time travel into the past - I can't
[02:27.90]What if I co-ould just run away
[02:30.67]I wonder where it would take me-e-e - not far
[02:35.29]So they say-y if you can't beat them joi-in them
[02:38.52]I ne-eed to make the best - of it
[02:42.67]Ever since I became different
[02:44.75]I've started to hate the path I never chose-en
[02:50.06]But ever since I was little
[02:52.14]I sometimes wished that I could fly
[02:54.67]really high - so why?
[02:57.44]That ever since I got wings
[02:59.29] I've started to feel bad - that still doesn't make sense
[03:04.83]But then I re-ealized that's because
[03:07.37]I am so far away - from my friends
[03:40.77] From my friends
