Life is like a hurrica~~ne
Here in Duckburg
Race cars, lasers, aeropla~~nes
It's a duck-blur
Might solve a mystery
Or rewrite history~
DuckTales, woohoo!
Every day they're out there making
DuckTales, woohoo!
Tales of daring do bad and good
LuckTales, woohoo!
D-d-d-danger watch behind you
There's a stranger out to find you
What to do, just grab onto some
DuckTales, woohoo!
Every day they're out there making
DuckTales, woohoo!
Tales of daring, bad and good
Not ponytails or cottontails, no
DuckTales, woohoo!
