[00:18.26]I'm sitting here in the sunshine
[00:21.76]This place is not mine
[00:23.31]And all is not fine
[00:25.09]Like where is all my corruption?
[00:28.25]I need destruction
[00:30.03]To make me feel okay
[00:31.96]Did I get lost along the way
[00:33.92]Playing nice like they wanted me to be?
[00:36.27]No, I will not smile to make your day
[00:38.45]I just wanna cause a little entropy
[00:40.72]You tried so hard
[00:43.04]To make a hero out of me
[00:45.32]But there are some rules I don't obey
[00:47.28]And I just wanna cause a little entropy
[00:58.67]You tried so hard
[01:00.88]To take the discord outta me
[01:02.98]But I'm not generic in that way
[01:05.26]And I just wanna cause a little entropy
[01:12.23]Well, I've got no good intention~
[01:15.46]The fourth dimension
[01:17.07]Is my own mansion
[01:19.10]It's all messed up, I don't care
[01:22.15]'cause what fun is there
[01:23.87]In ever making sense?
[01:25.79]Did I get lost along the way
[01:27.65]Lose my mind for a new identity?
[01:30.14]I quite enjoy ruin~ing your day
[01:32.14]And I just wanna cause a little entropy
[01:34.49]You tried so hard to make a hero outta me
[01:39.08]But there are some rules I don't obey
[01:41.18]And I just wanna cause a little chaos
[01:43.07]And entropy
[01:52.43]You tried so hard
[01:54.67]To take the discord outta me
[01:56.81]But I'm not generic in that way
[01:59.09]And I just wanna cause a little entropy
[02:17.14]I just want to cause a little entropy
[02:19.66]This old heart was never warm
[02:21.80]Silly ponies can't reform
[02:23.97]What was already so real
[02:28.42]So you can try to change my ways
[02:30.84]For the rest of all your days
[02:32.98]But I can't change the way I feel
[02:35.40]That was really cheesy
[02:37.57]Did I get lost along the way
[02:39.43]Lose my mind for a new identity?
[02:41.92]I quite enjoy ruin~ing your day
[02:43.98]And I just wanna cause a little entropy
[02:46.30]You tried so hard to make a hero outta me
[02:50.89]But there are some rules I don't obey
[02:52.96]And I just wanna cause a little-
[02:55.06]Yeah yeah~~~~~
[02:58.56]I'm causing all the entropy entropy yeah
[03:04.21]You tried so hard
[03:06.45]To take the discord outta me
[03:08.69]Guess what I wasn't born that way
[03:10.90]And I just wanna cause a little entropy
