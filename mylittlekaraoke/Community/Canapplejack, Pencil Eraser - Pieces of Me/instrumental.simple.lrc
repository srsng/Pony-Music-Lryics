[00:49.37]Maybe I'm not one to look past all the years I slave~ away~
[00:57.40]But I'm far from where I'll be someday
[01:00.18]They'll find~ me free from them at last
[01:05.29]Picking up pieces of~ me~
[01:09.18]Pieces of me~
[01:12.88]But my head's down on the pavement
[01:16.15]Wondering where the years went
[01:18.75]All the time I spent
[01:20.47]Under eyes full of contempt~
[01:24.26]My mind's still a crutch as
[01:27.13]I stand at the edge of what's ahead
[01:31.32]I'm frozen instead
[01:34.94]I might be chas~ing pipe~ dreams
[01:38.51]At least I'm chasing something more
[01:42.71]Than shadows on the city street
[01:46.23]They always said that I was green
[01:49.41]That I won't amount to anything~ more
[01:54.00]Than shadows on the city street
[01:57.48]They'll take back everything
[02:00.75]I'm not one to look past all the times I've been outcast~
[02:08.16]But someday I know that
[02:10.90]They'll find~ me free from them at last
[02:15.88]Picking up pieces of me~
[02:19.76]Pieces of me~
[02:23.03]When will I get to prove to them?
[02:28.59]When will I get my chance to win?
[02:34.94]Someday I'll finally piece myself toge~ther
[02:42.31]Yeah
[02:45.97]But my head's down on the pavement
[02:49.28]Wondering where the years went
[02:51.84]All the time I spent
[02:53.60]Under eyes full of contempt~
[02:57.48]My mind's still a crutch as I stand at the edge
[03:02.73]Of what's ahead
[03:04.59]I'm frozen instead
[03:08.07]I might be chas~ing pipe~ dreams
[03:11.65]At least I'm chasing something more
[03:15.93]Than shadows on the city street
[03:19.37]They always said that I was green
[03:22.54]That I won't amount to anything more
[03:27.22] than shadows on the city street
[03:30.66]They'll take back everything
[03:56.16]I might be chas~ing pipe~ dreams
[03:59.60]At least I'm chasing something more
[04:03.88]Than shadows on the city street
[04:07.41]They always said that I was green
[04:10.50]That I won't amount to anything more
[04:15.22]Than shadows on the city street
[04:18.66]They'll take back everything
