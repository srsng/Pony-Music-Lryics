My head in the clouds
My hooves on the ground
There’s a rainbow somewhere special
Either napping or dashing around
She said my wings were made of
Gossamer and morning dew
How can I hold all these apples
When I’m thinking of you?
Don't let me down
Don't let me fall
I can't pull myself together
Don't let me fall again
Don't let me down
Don't let me fall
I can't pull myself together
Don't let me fall
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me fall
I can't pull myself together
Don't let me fall again
Don't let me down
Don't let me fall
I can't pull myself together
Don't let me fall
Don't let me down~
