[00:11.77]It was a bright and sunny day~ in August
[00:15.56]Whe~n she came to town~
[00:23.02]She had a carriage full of props and tricks
[00:26.64]And a confidence that knew no bounds~
[00:33.65]And my heart skipped a beat as love I found
[00:51.30]The sun rose high as she got up on stage
[00:55.05]And started to perform her~ show~
[01:02.59]And as she shared her tricks I could feel~ the love
[01:05.99]Inside of me begin to grow~
[01:13.18]And my heart said don't you dare let her go
[01:19.89]Tri~xie you're the mare I love
[01:23.41]Girl you know it's true~
[01:27.25]There ain't no other po~ny like you
[01:31.18]Tri~xie you're the one I want
[01:34.31]No one can stop me~ now~
[01:38.46]I'm gonna make you mine somehow
[01:53.37]Some ponies say she has an ego
[01:57.30]Big enough for two but that's not~ true
