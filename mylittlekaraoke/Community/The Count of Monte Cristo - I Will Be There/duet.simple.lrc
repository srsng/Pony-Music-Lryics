[00:14.63][P1] In the light that falls at moonrise
[00:18.33][P1] In the rhythm of the rain
[00:21.99][P1] In the miracle of o-ordinary days
[00:29.27][P1] In the hush of night
[00:31.10][P1] I will be in the whispers of lovers
[00:35.70][P1] Every-ywhere
[00:39.36][P1] You will find me there
[00:44.08][P1] In the rustle of a curtain
[00:47.70][P1] In the bustle of the-e world
[00:51.40][P1] In a tho-ousand little unexpected ways
[00:58.68][P1] When you lift your gaze
[01:00.55][P1] I will be like the shimmer of o-one small star

[01:47.66][P2] In a language never spoken
[01:51.44][P2] With the promises we made
[01:55.06][P2] In the endless low that owns me heart and soul
[02:02.38][P2] In the certainty
[02:04.29][P2] I will always be true and as near as my next prayer
[02:12.63][P2] You will find me there
[02:17.35][P2] In the echo o' the ocean
[02:21.05][P2] In the haunting of the wind
[02:24.67][P2] In mysterious extraordinary ways
[02:31.99][P2] Through the darkest sky
[02:33.90][P2] I will be like the shimmer of one small star
[02:39.35][P2] O-out there
[02:42.08][P2] Shining everywhere

[03:17.02][P2] In the harbour quarter
[03:20.56][P1] In the sto-one and mortar
[03:24.10][P1] In the star that we both share
[03:24.10][P2] In the star that we both share
[03:30.89][P2] In the sound of laughter
[03:34.39][P1] Now and e-ever after
[03:37.81][P1] Look for me I will be there
[03:37.81][P2] Look for me I will be there
