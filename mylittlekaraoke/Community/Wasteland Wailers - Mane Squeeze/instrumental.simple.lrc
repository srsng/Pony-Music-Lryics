[00:12.68]It started out with a look~
[00:17.10]Sapphire eyes just to get~ me coo~kin’
[00:21.78]I knew I’d have you by hook or crook that night~
[00:30.81]You walked me back to my place~
[00:35.30]With bad ideas on my mind~, and my~ face
[00:39.94]No rhyme or reason, it’s just the season for~ love~
[00:49.36]Last night a little birdie told me I~ might not have your heart on~ lock~
[00:57.64]I don’t mean to dig, but this town~ ain’t too big~
[01:02.17]And the walls are starting to ta-a-a-alk~~!
[01:07.59]Spring flings come and go with the breeze
[01:11.41]And all my friends without are sayin’ I should be pleased~
[01:16.62]But it’d be nice to be your mane~~~~~ squeeze~
[01:30.28]Two weeks passed by and we ba~rely saw~ the out~side~ of my~ room~
[01:39.10]Breakfast in bed, and spoilin’ a girl~ could get used to~
[01:48.20]After we came down to earth~ I~ didn’t see you for a moon~
[01:57.29]They said that you had gone with June
[02:01.93]And June’s that dame who works at The Lagoon
[02:07.14]I know we weren’t talkin’ too much
[02:11.07]Mostly we was knockin shoes~~
[02:15.38]But when I hear you’re back in the or~chard pickin’ apples
[02:20.20]All I’m wonderin’ is whose~!
[02:24.66]Who~ she is doesn’t matter, what the hell, au revoir!
[02:31.26]But if one sliver of ya wants to stay where we are
[02:35.90]I’m gonna need some poetry and talkin’ till morn
[02:40.61]And maybe get to chattin’ bout a ring round this horn~
[02:45.57]That’s how it is~, like it or not
[02:49.64]So baby get to grovelin’ or get till you’re gone~
[02:55.06]Just say I’m your mane squeeze~
[02:58.84]I’ve gotta stop the shakin’
[03:00.70]In my four poor knees~!
[03:03.48]Please~ say I’m your~ mane~ squeeze~~!
[03:17.00]Or just get packin’ sugar.
