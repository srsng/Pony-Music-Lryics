I gave you my heart
And then you turned around
The secrets that we shared,
The moments that you cared
I gave you my heart
And then you turned around
We went streaking in the park,
Skinny dipping after dark
I gave you my heart
And then you turned around
Depressing melodies,
Suppressing fantasies
I gave you my heart
And then you turned
Aro-o-o-o-o-o-ound
I always wanted my own brother
And then he showed up at our door
I didn't question where he came from
I wasn't lonely anymore
Soon we did everything together
He taught me how to fly a kite
I watched him grow into a stallion
I watched him sleep in bed at night
It's not creepy
But then he signed that record label
A cute quintet of boyish sound
But now that everybody loves him
I'm just a face out in the crowd
I threw myself into my studies
To have the world in my control
I vaporized the competition
Nobody understands me
It's not evil
I gave you my heart
And then you turned around
Romantic pony dreams,
They never came to be
I gave you my heart
And then you turned around
Twilight please make this song end,
We're a bunch of floating heads!
Just take it from me,
I know you'll come around
Though the law forbids it,
This is kismet
Say "I do" and seal our souls together
Voulez-vous, our love will last fore-ever
Since we're not related it'll be okay
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed
