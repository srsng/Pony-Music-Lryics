[00:22.29][P1] I gave you my heart
[00:23.86][P1] And then you turned around
[00:26.64][P2] The secrets that we shared,
[00:28.85][P2] The moments that you cared
[00:31.14][P1] I gave you my heart
[00:32.68][P1] And then you turned around
[00:35.26][P2] We went streaking in the park,
[00:37.36][P2] Skinny dipping after dark
[00:39.91][P1] I gave you my heart
[00:41.56][P1] And then you turned around
[00:44.26][P2] Depressing melodies,
[00:46.48][P2] Suppressing fantasies
[00:48.76][P1] I gave you my heart
[00:50.38][P1] And then you turned
[00:51.73][P1]  Aro-o-o-o-o-o-ound
[01:00.24][P1] I always wanted my own brother
[01:03.16][P1] And then he showed up at our door
[01:06.20][P1] I didn't question where he came from
[01:09.20][P1] I wasn't lonely anymore
[01:12.16][P1] Soon we did everything together
[01:15.16][P1] He taught me how to fly a kite
[01:18.16][P1] I watched him grow into a stallion
[01:21.16][P1] I watched him sleep in bed at night
[01:23.26][P1] It's not creepy
[01:27.13][P1] But then he signed that record label
[01:30.09][P1] A cute quintet of boyish sound
[01:33.13][P1] But now that everybody loves him
[01:36.13][P1] I'm just a face out in the crowd
[01:39.16][P1] I threw myself into my studies
[01:42.13][P1] To have the world in my control
[01:45.16][P1] I vaporized the competition
[01:48.13][P1] Nobody understands me
[01:50.26][P1] It's not evil
[01:52.96][P1] I gave you my heart
[01:52.96][P2] I gave you my heart
[01:54.20][P1] And then you turned around
[01:54.20][P2] And then you turned around
[01:56.00][P1] Romantic pony dreams,
[01:57.50][P1] They never came to be
[01:59.04][P1] I gave you my heart
[01:59.04][P2] I gave you my heart
[02:00.16][P1] And then you turned around
[02:00.16][P2] And then you turned around
[02:01.85][P2] Twilight please make this song end,
[02:03.35][P2] We're a bunch of floating heads!
[02:04.96][P1] Just take it from me,
[02:06.20][P1] I know you'll come around
[02:10.06][P1] Though the law forbids it,
[02:10.06][P2] Though the law forbids it,
[02:11.79][P1] This is kismet
[02:11.79][P2] This is kismet
[02:13.40][P1] Say "I do" and seal our souls together
[02:16.44][P2] Voulez-vous, our love will last fore-ever
[02:19.44][P1] Since we're not related it'll be okay
[02:19.44][P2] Since we're not related it'll be okay
[02:26.94][P1] So different now from what it seemed
[02:32.98][P1] Now life has killed the dream I dreamed
