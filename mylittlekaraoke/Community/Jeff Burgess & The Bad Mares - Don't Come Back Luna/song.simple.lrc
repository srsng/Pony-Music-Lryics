[00:27.06]Don't come back Luna
[00:28.34]I don't want you around here
[00:30.89]I'm just a filly but I'm taking a stand
[00:34.03]Oh~ no, don't come back Luna
[00:36.55]You ain't such a big shot
[00:39.01]You think it's your land but I tell you it's not
[00:43.52]A new stained glass window pane
[00:47.01]A prophecy that's been rewritten again
[00:51.05]A new story to tell all your foals
[00:55.03]They'll turn to legend and then forgotten scrolls
[00:59.55]You never know
[01:02.07]Just how it feels to be alone
[01:04.28]'Til you're cryin' for your thro-o-o-one
[01:07.08]Don't come back Luna
[01:08.35]I don't want you around here
[01:11.00]I'm just a filly but I'm taking a stand
[01:14.08]Oh no, don't come back Luna, you ain't such a big shot
[01:19.05]You think it's your land but I tell you it's not
[01:23.53]I'm not the type for jealousy
[01:26.99]But sister I won't let you usurp me
[01:31.50]I'm not afraid to use my horn
[01:35.02]The sun will rule the moon 'til twilight is born
[01:39.56]You won't get free
[01:42.02]It's perfectly meant to be
[01:44.01]Just like elements of harmony
[01:47.03]Don't come back Luna
[01:48.33]I don't want you around here
[01:51.01]I'm just a filly but I'm taking a stand
[01:54.00]Oh no, don't come back Luna
[01:56.52]You ain't such a big shot
[01:58.97]You think it's your land but I tell you it's not
[02:11.05]One little pony left without a home
[02:15.00]Two little fillies with a new world to roam~
[02:19.04]One thousand years or maybe more it'll be
[02:23.02]Six little ponies it'll take to set you free, ah!
[02:27.01]Don't come back Luna

[02:39.05]You think it's your land
[02:40.51]You really think it's your land, baby
[02:43.00]Don't come back Luna
[02:44.34]I don't want you around here
[02:46.58]Oh, I'm just a filly, but this is my stand
[02:50.00]Oh~ no, don't come back Luna
[02:52.55]You ain't such a big shot
[02:55.04]You think it's your land but I tell you it's not
