[13:52.16][P1] How can you say this?
[13:54.79][P1] Don’t we deserve bliss?
[13:57.75][P1] Is it a crime~ to share a bond?
[14:02.25][P2] You know that is not the way
[14:04.88][P1] Can we never love, never just disobey?
[14:07.54][P2] Duty takes priority
[14:10.12][P1] But he is a king, the same royalty
[14:12.71][P2] Bound by his mortality
[14:15.38][P1] That doesn’t matter, at least not to me
[14:18.11][P2] But it will

[14:20.66][P1] You must know that
[14:20.66][P2] You must know that
[14:22.84][P1] Heavy is the crown we wear
[14:22.91][P2] Heavy is the crown we wear

[15:27.08][P1] Yes I did but now we~ need to~ talk~~
[15:36.75][P1] I have been thinking
[15:39.41][P1] My heart’s been sinking
[15:42.38][P1] And I don’t think we can go on
[15:47.25][P2] What are you saying?
[15:49.88][P2] You must be playing…
[15:52.88][P2] What could have changed, what did I do wrong?
[15:57.34][P1] Please, you do not share the blame
[16:00.04][P2] Tell me that you’re wrong, that we are still the same
[16:02.74][P1] It’s already killing me
[16:05.36][P2] Or was it the “queen”, your dear sister’s decree?
[16:07.99][P1] I’ll watch you grow old and gray
[16:10.58][P2] I don’t have to die, there still might be a way
[16:13.27][P1] But you will
[16:14.62][P2] Even still
[16:15.79][P1] You must know that
[16:15.79][P2] You must know that
[16:18.08][P1] Heavy is the crown we wear
[16:18.11][P2] Heavy is the crown we wear
[16:22.54][P1] Missing the short-lived life that we share
[16:23.62][P2] Why just discard the life we could share?
[16:27.04][P1] Left to grieve for all eternity~~~
[16:27.41][P2] Must we flee~ before e~ternity~~?
[16:36.04][P2] Heavy is the crown we wear
[16:36.08][P1] Heavy is the crown we wear
[16:40.54][P1] That is the cost, the burden I bear
[16:41.62][P2] At any cost, I’ll take it and bear
[16:45.04][P1] Sombra, please, you have to~ let me go~~~~
[16:45.45][P2] Luna, I~ will never~ let you go~~~
[18:03.86][P1] And so she left~ him
[18:03.86][P2] And so she left~ him
[18:08.59][P1] Both of them silent and destitute
[18:08.59][P2] Both of them silent and destitute
[18:13.65][P1] His spirit maligned

[23:58.61][P1] Oh, my king, what miracle is this?
[24:05.74][P1] Here I thought we’d share our final kiss
[24:12.79][P1] Now~ to see~ you draped in onyx wings
[24:16.84][P1] You cannot know~ the joy it brings
[24:27.04][P2] How could I just let you slip away?
[24:34.09][P2] When, no matter what, I’d find a way
[24:41.25][P2] Nothing known could disagree, and
[24:44.81][P2] Keep you away from me
[24:48.71][P2] Why spend these ages trapped in loneliness?
[24:52.28][P1] Why should it be?
[24:54.79][P1] When we could rule as regents of~ the dark~ness
[24:54.79][P2] When we could rule as regents of~ the dark~ness
[25:19.54][P2] Think of how the world~ could really be

[28:10.61][P1] Do you understand the words you say?
[28:18.90][P1] Must this spell have lead your mind astray?
[28:26.55][P1] Wait there safe beloved king, I’ll find~ the cure~ and bring
[28:35.03][P1] Then once I have you back we can pro~fess

[28:41.96][P1] Eternal love~ as regents of the dark~ness!
[28:41.96][P2] Eternal love as regents of the dar~kness!
[29:28.09][P1] Look what your piety has wrought
[29:31.50][P1] Driven him into recklessness
[29:34.12][P1] Through some strange talisman he brought
[29:37.16][P1] On a curse while trying to ascend!
[29:40.20][P2] If he has dabbled in this way
[29:43.12][P2] How am I the one that you condemn?
[29:46.31][P2] Whatever price could he have paid?
[29:49.12][P2] Do you even know what you defend?

[41:22.09][P1] Oh, what a sight to see
[41:23.62][P1] That you would offer up your armies and
[41:25.20][P1] Renounce your sovereignty
[41:27.71][P1] At least hold on to your dignity
[41:29.93][P1] And just surrender yourself
[41:31.35][P1] And your power willingly
[41:34.54][P1] We revoke your infernal doctrine
[41:36.53][P1] Renounce the mantle you have laid

[42:16.65][P2] That you would desecrate your kingdom
[42:18.07][P2] Bring them into this abyss
[42:20.70][P2] Reverse this curse that afflicts them all
[42:22.99][P2] Or in this battle you will face
[42:24.41][P2] I promise, you will fall!
[42:27.53][P2] Your emotions have left you blinded
[42:29.66][P2] Would you just throw this peace away?
[42:32.14][P2] Tonight, it ends, so loose their bindings
[42:35.06][P2] Don’t prolong this sad display!
[42:37.35][P1] Oh ah ah

[43:27.94][P1] For above all else, it’s the only covenant
[43:33.00][P1] I would ever keep and follow to my grave~~
[43:58.24][P2] Once I simply thought, that we could rise above
[44:03.26][P2] All the trials that we~ might face together
[44:08.36][P2] But this dark descent, con~sumed the one I love
[44:13.24][P2] Return to me, before this brings the end
[44:18.53][P2] Heaven's fury~ raining~ down
[44:23.51][P2] We can’t ignore our hea~vy~ crowns
[44:27.22][P1] Heavy crowns
