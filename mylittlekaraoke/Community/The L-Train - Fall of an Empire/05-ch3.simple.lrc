[13:41.62]Luna, come sit here
[13:44.25]It’s become quite clear
[13:47.29]You’ve let your heart grow far too fond
[13:52.16]How can you say this?
[13:54.79]Don’t we deserve bliss?
[13:57.75]Is it a crime~ to share a bond?
[14:04.88]Can we never love, never just disobey?
[14:10.12]But he is a king, the same royalty
[14:15.38]That doesn’t matter, at least not to me
[14:19.31]Even still
[14:20.66]You must know that
[14:22.84]Heavy is the crown we wear
[14:28.46]Why must it be, the burden I bear?
[14:32.29]How can I live with a broken heart~~~?
[15:17.21]Well hello my dear, I thought you had gone~~~
[15:27.08]Yes I did but now we~ need to~ talk~~
[15:36.75]I have been thinking
[15:39.41]My heart’s been sinking
[15:42.38]And I don’t think we can go on
[15:47.25]What are you saying?
[15:49.88]You must be playing…
[15:52.88]What could have changed, what did I do wrong?
[15:57.34]Please, you do not share the blame
[16:02.74]It’s already killing me
[16:07.99]I’ll watch you grow old and gray
[16:13.27]But you will
[16:15.79]You must know that
[16:18.08]Heavy is the crown we wear
[16:22.54]Missing the short-lived life that we share
[16:27.04]Left to grieve for all eternity~~~
[16:36.08]Heavy is the crown we wear
[16:40.54]That is the cost, the burden I bear
[16:45.04]Sombra, please, you have to~ let me go~~~~
