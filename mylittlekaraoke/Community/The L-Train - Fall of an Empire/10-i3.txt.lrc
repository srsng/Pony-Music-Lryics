As weeks did pass
And the princess carried on
Growing more withdrawn
Her sister saw
The painful tears in her eyes~
And empathized
They took her back
To a far and distant place
Searching for embrace
And truly hoped
There was an answer too
For all their sakes
That she might break
Their hea~vy chainâ€¦
