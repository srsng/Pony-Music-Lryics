[04:42.07]The North is beautiful, the land at rest so peacefully
[04:47.55]Why did we wait so long to travel up to~ see?
[04:53.02]Oh yes, it’s overdue, but now we’re making history
[04:58.54]To draw much closer ties

[05:04.09]My warmest welcome to you dears
[05:06.75]I hope safe travels brought you here
[05:09.56]Come feast your eyes, there’s much to show
[05:12.30]Of our oasis in the snow

[06:09.86](Gleaming) in the sun our colors shine in every hue
[06:14.66]We’ve fought off every foe and seen our troubles through
[06:20.32]Standing side-by-side, two nations fortunate and free
[06:25.61]A righteous pony empire spanning sea to sea!
