[00:01.80]Hello weary traveler
[00:06.97]You strike me, an admirer, of ancient lore
[00:12.53]With a penchant I see
[00:14.85]For old history
[00:17.66]As you’ve never heard it before
[00:27.52]It’s a familiar tale
[00:31.54]Of a once mighty king
[00:34.58]But the story you know
[00:36.52]Goes much deeper, so
[00:38.77]Sit back as I tell you and sing
[00:42.71]There once was a colt with a coat dark as coal
[00:46.35]Who had eyes of a bright burning red
[00:50.59]Courageous and strong, it was not very long
[00:54.41]‘til the crown was bestowed on his head
[00:58.73]For the king in the North had to be a great force
[01:02.36]To survive all the harsh elements
[01:06.56]But the power he held from the keep where he dwelled
[01:10.65]Would lead to his people’s lament~
[01:47.85]But there was a time
[01:49.54]When his rule was kind
[01:51.26]When the kingdom was wealthy and thrived
[01:54.26]Someone caught his eye
[01:55.65]And he soon realized
[01:57.71]That he wanted a wife by his side
[02:01.58]He thought all was right
[02:03.30]They saw eye to eye
[02:04.99]A princess from a Southern ally
[02:07.84]His heart had grown fond
[02:09.26]As they fostered a bond
[02:11.29]That the world could not ever defy
[02:15.86]Grand Regent
[02:19.28]Unequaled
[02:22.69]Transcendent
[02:26.14]Eternal
[02:56.40]Both hearts longing for simple love to soar
[02:59.62]But nothing’s simple for kingdoms and kings
[03:03.26]What stands certainly?
[03:04.95]For eternity?
[03:06.49]Fear what a veiled future brings
[03:10.72]One thing’s for sure
[03:14.51]As the ages move on
[03:17.70]The harshest of debts
[03:19.46]Is to live with regret
[03:21.79]So chase what you love
[03:23.62]Or you’ll find it’s departed and gone…
