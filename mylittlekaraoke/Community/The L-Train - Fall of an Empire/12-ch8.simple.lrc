[39:58.88]Grand Regent
[40:02.32]Unequaled
[40:05.78]Transcendent
[40:09.15]Eternal
[41:22.09]Oh, what a sight to see
[41:23.62]That you would offer up your armies and
[41:25.20]Renounce your sovereignty
[41:27.71]At least hold on to your dignity
[41:29.93]And just surrender yourself
[41:31.35]And your power willingly
[41:34.54]We revoke your infernal doctrine
[41:36.53]Renounce the mantle you have laid
[41:39.15]Your laws, your rule, will be forgotten
[41:42.07]As your light is left to fade!
[41:44.36]Heaven's fury raining down
[41:49.31]Kneel before the aurora’s crown
[41:54.38]Sun and shadow both will bow
[41:59.44]Living as my queen and I allow
[42:15.11]How~ could you fall~ to this
[42:16.65]That you would desecrate your kingdom
[42:18.07]Bring them into this abyss
[42:20.70]Reverse this curse that afflicts them all
[42:22.99]Or in this battle you will face
[42:24.41]I promise, you will fall!
[42:27.53]Your emotions have left you blinded
[42:29.66]Would you just throw this peace away?
[42:32.14]Tonight, it ends, so loose their bindings
[42:35.06]Don’t prolong this sad display!
[42:37.35]Heaven's fury~ raining~ down
[42:42.41]Cast aside this corrupted crown
[42:47.47]You forsake your~ royal~ vows
[42:52.54]For a crime I simply can’t allow!
[43:17.81]Know that in the end, you can’t make us relent
[43:22.91]We won’t let you take away our love again!
[43:27.94]For above all else, it’s the only covenant
[43:33.00]I would ever keep and follow to my grave~~
[43:58.24]Once I simply thought, that we could rise above
[44:03.26]All the trials that we~ might face together
[44:08.36]But this dark descent, con~sumed the one I love
[44:13.24]Return to me, before this brings the end
[44:18.53]Heaven's fury~ raining~ down
[44:23.51]We can’t ignore our hea~vy~ crowns
[44:28.54]We can make it work somehow
[44:33.68]If your pride would~ on~ly~ just allow
[45:51.56]You sacrifice your fate, abandon our future
[45:56.70]You choose to desecrate, and let our love fade away~~~
[46:03.04]But you won’t win this day
[46:05.47]Despite your treachery~~
[46:07.99]No matter what you say
[46:10.46]The empire belongs to me~~~~~~
[46:14.78]Come to the darkness, all who have offered up
[46:17.70]Their souls to me
[46:19.16]Into the starless tundra
[46:21.22]You’ll follow your true and rightful king
[46:23.85]Come to the darkness, all who have offered up
[46:26.70]Of their souls to me
[46:28.91]Into the starless tundra, you’ll follow
[46:31.43]Your true and rightful king
[46:33.86]Come to the darkness, all who have offered up
[46:36.75]Of their souls to me
[46:38.81]Into the starless tundra
[46:40.72]You’ll follow your true and rightful—
