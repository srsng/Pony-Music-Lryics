[40:05.78][P1] Transcendent
[40:05.78][P2] Transcendent
[40:09.15][P1] Eternal
[40:09.15][P2] Eternal
[41:22.09][P1] Oh, what a sight to see
[41:23.62][P1] That you would offer up your armies and
[41:25.20][P1] Renounce your sovereignty
[41:27.71][P1] At least hold on to your dignity
[41:29.93][P1] And just surrender yourself
[41:31.35][P1] And your power willingly
[41:34.54][P1] We revoke your infernal doctrine
[41:36.53][P1] Renounce the mantle you have laid
[41:39.15][P1] Your laws, your rule, will be forgotten
[41:42.07][P1] As your light is left to fade!

[41:55.31][P2] Oh ah
[41:58.16][P2] Both will bow
[41:59.44][P1] Living as my queen and I allow
[42:00.38][P2] Oh ah, oh oh
[42:15.11][P2] How~ could you fall~ to this
[42:16.65][P2] That you would desecrate your kingdom
[42:18.07][P2] Bring them into this abyss
[42:20.70][P2] Reverse this curse that afflicts them all
[42:22.99][P2] Or in this battle you will face
[42:24.41][P2] I promise, you will fall!
[42:27.53][P2] Your emotions have left you blinded
[42:29.66][P2] Would you just throw this peace away?
[42:32.14][P2] Tonight, it ends, so loose their bindings
[42:35.06][P2] Don’t prolong this sad display!
[42:37.35][P1] Oh ah ah
[42:37.35][P2] Heaven's fury~ raining~ down
[42:41.14][P1] Raining down
[42:42.41][P2] Cast aside this corrupted crown
[42:43.35][P1] Ah ah

[42:47.47][P2] You forsake your~ royal~ vows
[42:48.45][P1] Ah ah

[42:52.54][P2] For a crime I simply can’t allow!
[42:53.47][P1] Ah ah, oh oh
[43:17.81][P1] Know that in the end, you can’t make us relent
[43:22.91][P1] We won’t let you take away our love again!
[43:27.94][P1] For above all else, it’s the only covenant
[43:33.00][P1] I would ever keep and follow to my grave~~
[43:58.24][P2] Once I simply thought, that we could rise above
[44:03.26][P2] All the trials that we~ might face together
[44:08.36][P2] But this dark descent, con~sumed the one I love
[44:13.24][P2] Return to me, before this brings the end
[44:18.53][P2] Heaven's fury~ raining~ down
[44:23.51][P2] We can’t ignore our hea~vy~ crowns
[44:27.22][P1] Heavy crowns
[44:28.54][P2] We can make it work somehow
[44:29.47][P1] Oh oh
[44:32.29][P1] Work somehow
[44:33.68][P2] If your pride would~ on~ly~ just allow
[44:34.50][P1] Oh oh, oh-
[45:51.56][P1] You sacrifice your fate, abandon our future
[45:56.70][P1] You choose to desecrate, and let our love fade away~~~
[46:03.04][P1] But you won’t win this day
[46:05.47][P1] Despite your treachery~~
[46:07.99][P1] No matter what you say
[46:10.46][P1] The empire belongs to me~~~~~~
[46:14.78][P1] Come to the darkness, all who have offered up
[46:17.70][P1] Their souls to me
[46:19.16][P1] Into the starless tundra
[46:21.22][P1] You’ll follow your true and rightful king
[46:23.85][P1] Come to the darkness, all who have offered up
[46:26.70][P1] Of their souls to me
[46:28.91][P1] Into the starless tundra, you’ll follow
[46:31.43][P1] Your true and rightful king
[46:33.86][P2] Come to the darkness, all who have offered up
[46:36.75][P2] Of their souls to me
