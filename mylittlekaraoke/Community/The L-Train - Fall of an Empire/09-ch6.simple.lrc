[29:28.09]Look what your piety has wrought
[29:31.50]Driven him into recklessness
[29:34.12]Through some strange talisman he brought
[29:37.16]On a curse while trying to ascend!
[29:43.12]How am I the one that you condemn?
[29:46.31]Whatever price could he have paid?
[29:49.12]Do you even know what you defend?

[31:31.54]For my reign!
