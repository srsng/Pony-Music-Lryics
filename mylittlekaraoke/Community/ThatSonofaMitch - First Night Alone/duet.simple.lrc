[00:15.45][P1] Skies are dark
[00:16.70][P1] A lifeless sanguine abyss~
[00:19.48][P1] Keep hoping for a day
[00:21.16][P1] When you think you'll be missed~
[00:22.80][P1] So start your journey
[00:24.12][P1] A thousand times you've done this before
[00:26.74][P1] 'Cause the life worth living
[00:28.62][P1] Isn't there anymore~
[01:00.45][P1] Memories~ that go through the eons' past
[01:04.16][P2] So many friends that you've just lost track
[01:07.29][P1] When all your friends have gone
[01:08.93][P1] The chapter ahead looks black
[01:11.70][P2] You can try your best but you can't turn back
[01:14.75][P1] Forever you trot down this lonely road
[01:18.50][P1] Companionless, upset and alone
[01:23.19][P2] The magic of friendship is a feeling unknown
[01:31.94][P1] Time and space don't mean a thing
[01:38.89][P1] And why should they
[01:40.84][P1] When you've lost the meaning they bring
[01:46.39][P1] These tales of~ old
[01:50.22][P1] Everlasting Life's the very curse you loathe~
[01:53.73][P2] When will you learn, Colgate
[01:56.08][P2] When things don't look up
[01:57.45][P1] That's not the time to stop
[01:59.36][P1] Or contemplate giving up~
[02:01.23][P2] So keep your head up high~
[02:03.30][P1] Don't~ ever look back
[02:04.98][P2] 'Cause girl it's worth a try~
[02:06.98][P1] Keep your sights straight for~ward
[02:08.73][P2] So keep your head up high~
[02:11.08][P1] And soon you will see
[02:12.45][P1] There's more to life
[02:12.45][P2] There's more to life
[02:13.58][P1] Than this game~ of immortality
[02:13.58][P2] Than this game~

[02:28.62][P2] Than this game~ of immortality
[03:01.86][P1] Days turn to months to years
[03:03.97][P1] As the centuries pass
[03:06.08][P2] Every day feels longer than the rest you had
[03:09.12][P1] 'Cause everywhere you go
[03:10.73][P1] You find pieces of your past
[03:13.66][P2] Bringing back the memories
[03:15.53][P2] You forgot you had
[03:16.78][P1] And every time you fall in love you know
[03:20.34][P1] Remind yourself that you gotta let go
[03:25.06][P1] Remember the moment you first felt alone
[03:25.06][P2] Remember the moment you first felt alone
[03:46.90][P1] Time and space don't mean a thing
[03:53.89][P1] And why should they
