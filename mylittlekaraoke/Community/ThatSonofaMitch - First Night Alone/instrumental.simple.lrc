[00:15.45]Skies are dark
[00:16.70]A lifeless sanguine abyss~
[00:19.48]Keep hoping for a day
[00:21.16]When you think you'll be missed~
[00:22.80]So start your journey
[00:24.12]A thousand times you've done this before
[00:26.74]'Cause the life worth living
[00:28.62]Isn't there anymore~
[01:00.45]Memories~ that go through the eons' past
[01:07.29]When all your friends have gone
[01:08.93]The chapter ahead looks black
[01:14.75]Forever you trot down this lonely road
[01:18.50]Companionless, upset and alone
[01:31.94]Time and space don't mean a thing
[01:38.89]And why should they
[01:40.84]When you've lost the meaning they bring
[01:46.39]These tales of~ old
[01:50.22]Everlasting Life's the very curse you loathe~
[01:57.45]That's not the time to stop
[01:59.36]Or contemplate giving up~
[02:03.30]Don't~ ever look back
[02:06.98]Keep your sights straight for~ward
[02:11.08]And soon you will see
[02:12.45]There's more to life
[02:13.58]Than this game~ of immortality
[02:18.30]Don't ever look back
[02:22.02]Keep your sights straight for~ward
[02:26.00]And soon you will see
[02:27.45]There's more to life
[02:28.62]Than this game~ of immortality
[03:01.86]Days turn to months to years
[03:03.97]As the centuries pass
[03:09.12]'Cause everywhere you go
[03:10.73]You find pieces of your past
[03:16.78]And every time you fall in love you know
[03:20.34]Remind yourself that you gotta let go
[03:25.06]Remember the moment you first felt alone
[03:46.90]Time and space don't mean a thing
[03:53.89]And why should they
[03:55.92]When you've lost the meaning they bring
[04:01.35]These tales of~ old
[04:05.18]Everlasting Life's the very curse you loathe~
[04:12.41]That's not the time to stop
[04:14.32]Or contemplate giving up~
[04:18.27]Don't~ ever look back
[04:21.94]Keep your sights straight for~ward
[04:26.04]And soon you will see
[04:27.41]There's more to life
[04:28.54]Than this game~ of immortality
[04:33.27]Don't ever look back
[04:36.98]Keep your sights straight for~ward
[04:40.96]And soon you will see
[04:42.41]There's more to life
[04:43.58]Than this game~ of immortality
[05:16.66]It's just not e~very day
[05:19.48]You see a unicorn who forges her own way
[05:25.10]Reminding you Colgate to tie up loose ends
[05:28.89]What good is this love
[05:30.26]If you'll just get hurt again?
[05:36.31]What good is the morning
[05:38.03]If the night never comes?
[05:43.85]What good is the morning
[05:45.53]If the night never comes?
