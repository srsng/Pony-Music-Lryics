Another night I spend alone
Another silent mare forced out in the cold
My mind is left to wonder
When do my dreams come true
This starry night we're under
Are the stars dreaming too
And I know now
The truth we seek
In this lonely night
Isn't quite so bleak
It's Ok
I'm right here
Don't you ever feel alone
If you ever need a shoulder
To cry on
Come find me
You're not different
We're all the same
I seem to blend in perfectly
It's as though they can't even see
I'm standing right in front of them
I'm standing right before them
And it seems crystal clear
Nobody wants me here
Why do we even go on
When everybody's screaming
I know now
The truth we seek
These lonely nights
Isn't quite so bleak
It's Ok
I'm right here
Don't you ever feel alone
If you ever need a shoulder
To cry on
Come find me
You're not different
We're all the same
It's Ok
I'm right here
Don't you ever feel alone
If you ever need a shoulder
To cry on
Come find me
You're not different
We're all the same
And if you try
I know you'll win
Just spread your wings
And fly
