[00:33.54]My eyes have seen this
[00:35.47]The cold of indignation
[00:37.41]They always look here
[00:39.21]I feel their lacerations
[00:41.23]I'll never be enough
[00:43.14]I'll stumble back again
[00:45.02]But I don't care enough
[00:46.84]I wish I had a friend
[00:48.79]How many times did I try
[00:50.68]They pushed me too far
[00:52.42]The great and the powerful Trixie
[00:54.82]Knows just what you are
[00:56.46]But is it worth it now?
[00:58.29]Is this all that I am?
[00:60.00]You wish I had never appeared
[01:01.91]I just wish you'd give a damn
[01:05.70]I trusted them
[01:11.19]To see what's inside of me~
[01:14.23]I trusted me~~
[01:18.77]To see what's inside of them~
[01:28.84]I may have stumbled once
[01:30.39]On my insignificance
[01:32.38]But that is all over now
[01:34.09]I've let go of my dissonance
[01:36.11]"Our eyes a purple haze
[01:38.08]We share the same shade"
[01:39.97]Yours see power
[01:40.91]Mine see magic
[01:41.79]See a friendship we could have made
[01:43.78]"She is so talented!"
[01:45.69]But what is there for me~?
[01:47.64]"I've seen a better show"
[01:49.31]But I, she will never see
[01:51.64]Orion save me now
[01:55.54]Polaris guide me now
[02:00.94]I trusted them
[02:06.45]To see what's inside of me~
[02:09.52]I trusted me~~
[02:14.02]To see what's inside of (them)
[02:16.44]The water's rising
[02:18.13]How long until I drown?
[02:20.29]My only sorrow is my head was never in the clouds
[02:23.98]The water's rising
[02:25.78]How long until I die?
[02:27.79]I'm suffoca~ting
[02:29.55]On tears I hold back inside
[02:31.93]Water's rising
[02:35.66]How long until I drown~?
[02:39.66]My only sorrow
[02:42.37]Is that I never stilled my frown
[02:47.14]The water's rising
[02:50.94]How long until I die?
[02:54.81]I'm suffoca~ting
[02:57.66]On tears I'm holding back inside
[03:02.46]I'm only drowning
[03:05.70]On my loss of self-control
[03:10.03]The water's risen
[03:13.05]And I'm left with an empty soul~
[03:17.59]I've stumbled for the last time
[03:21.47]I'll leave this place forever
[03:25.16]My arrogance precedes me
[03:29.04]It's been a mute endeavor
[03:32.92]I trusted them
[03:37.86]To see what's inside of me~
[03:41.08]I trusted me~
[03:45.43]To see what's inside of them~
[03:48.60]Drowning on my loss of self-control
[03:51.62]The water's risen~
[03:53.34]And I'm left with a empty soul
[03:55.54]I never thought I'd
[03:57.09]End without a cause to blame
[03:59.08]But you were the one there to show me
[04:01.12]It's not about the fame~
