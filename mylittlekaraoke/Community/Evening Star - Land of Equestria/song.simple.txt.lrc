We will sing
Toge~~ther
And the mountains will hear our call
And we will
Raise our vo~ices
Remembered forever, the Land of Equestria
We will dance
Through the country
And the night and the day will be one
Holding hooves, we will u~~nite
As one mind, as one soul, the name of Equestria
Oh~, Luna's night full of bri~ght stars
With the moon shining down on the land
Ce~lestia's
Summer ski~~es
To guide us, to lead us, in ruling Equestria
We will live
In joyous laugh~ter
With the love and the trust that we share
And the world
Will know the go~od times
Glory and honour, the Land of Equestria
