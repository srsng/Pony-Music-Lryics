[00:27.98]The moon shines across the darkened sky
[00:33.29]As the snow falls and covers our homes in the-e night
[00:38.99]The wind blows against the barren trees
[00:44.43]A place so beautiful it can't be real, it seems
[00:49.88]As winter sets in ove-er time
[00:55.23]The city-y co-omes ali-ive
[01:02.39]Sing through the night
[01:05.18]Eyes shining bright
[01:07.92]See the stars dance acro-oss the sky-y
[01:13.41]Bundled up tight
[01:15.42]Watch the ho-ours tick by
[01:18.85]This is how we spend our Canterlot nights
[01:28.49]Lights illuminate the city streets
[01:33.93]Dreaming up tomorro-ow while we sleep
[01:39.46]Fires burning brightly-y in the dark
[01:44.78]As ponies sit around the-em, warming up our hearts
[01:50.26]As winter sets in ove-er time
[01:55.58]The city-y co-omes ali-ive
[02:02.69]Sing through the night
[02:05.52]Eyes shining bright
[02:08.22]See the stars dance acro-oss the sky-y
[02:13.75]Bundled up tight
[02:15.81]Watch the ho-ours tick by
[02:19.19]This is how we spend our Canterlot nights
[02:38.44]Sing through the night
[02:41.14]Eyes shining bright
[02:44.01]See the stars dance acro-oss the sky
[02:49.41]Bundled up tight
[02:51.47]Watch the ho-ours tick by
[02:54.89]This is how we spend our Canterlot
[03:03.77]Sing through the night
[03:06.55]Eyes shining bright
[03:09.25]See the stars dance acro-oss the sky-y
[03:14.78]Bundled up tight
[03:16.79]Watch the ho-ours tick by
[03:20.27]This is how we spend our Canterlot nights
[03:25.71]Sing through the night
[03:28.50]Eyes shining bright
[03:31.20]See the stars dance acro-oss the sky-y
