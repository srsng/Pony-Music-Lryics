[00:30.89]This is how we spend our Canterlot nights
[00:36.76]I like it
[01:06.38]The moon shines across the darkened sky
[01:11.69]As the snow falls and covers our homes in the-e night
[01:17.39]The wind blows against the barren trees
[01:22.83]A place so beautiful it can't be real, it seems
[01:28.28]As winter sets in ove-er time
[01:33.63]The city-y co-omes ali-ive
[01:40.79]Sing through the night
[01:43.58]Eyes shining bright
[01:46.32]See the stars dance acro-oss the sky-y
[01:51.81]Bundled up tight
[01:53.82]Watch the ho-ours tick by
[01:57.25]This is how we spend our Canterlot nights
[02:06.89]Lights illuminate the city streets
[02:12.33]Dreaming up tomorro-ow while we sleep
[02:17.86]Fires burning brightly-y in the dark
[02:23.18]As ponies sit around the-em, warming up our hearts
[02:28.66]As winter sets in ove-er time
[02:33.98]The city-y co-omes ali-ive
[02:41.09]Sing through the night
[02:43.92]Eyes shining bright
[02:46.62]See the stars dance acro-oss the sky-y
[02:52.15]Bundled up tight
