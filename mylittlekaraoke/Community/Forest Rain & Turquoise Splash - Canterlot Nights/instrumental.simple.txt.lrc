The moon shines across the darkened sky
As the snow falls and covers our homes in the night
The wind blows against the barren trees
A place so beautiful it can't be real, it seems
As winter sets in over time
The city comes alive
Sing through the night
Eyes shining bright
See the stars dance across the sky
Bundled up tight
Watch the hours tick by
This is how we spend our Canterlot nights
Lights illuminate the city streets
Dreaming up tomorrow while we sleep
Fires burning brightly in the dark
As ponies sit around them, warming up our hearts
As winter sets in over time
The city comes alive
Sing through the night
Eyes shining bright
See the stars dance across the sky
Bundled up tight
Watch the hours tick by
This is how we spend our Canterlot nights
Sing through the night
Eyes shining bright
See the stars dance across the sky
Bundled up tight
Watch the hours tick by
This is how we spend our Canterlot
Sing through the night
Eyes shining bright
See the stars dance across the sky
Bundled up tight
Watch the hours tick by
This is how we spend our Canterlot nights
Sing through the night
Eyes shining bright
See the stars dance across the sky
Bundled up tight
Watch the hours tick by
This is how we spend our Canterlot nights
