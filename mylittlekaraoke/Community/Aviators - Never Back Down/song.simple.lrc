[02:48.85]But the tough ponies never ever give up
[02:51.13]Enough, I wouldn't be here if I sat and groaned
[02:53.16]And moaned about the times that I've felt alone
[02:55.00]I grew a backbone and I told 'em all sup
[02:57.25]And made a promise to never ever give up
[02:59.27]I'm a stroller, I don't need a clover for luck

[03:03.43]If you stand up life only just gets doper
[03:05.80]Never give up and your cup runneth over
[03:07.82]Not a moper, sober when I toss my frown
[03:09.77]I continued moving up, never falling back down
[03:11.91]And around this time I should say to you
[03:13.78]That you should follow the lifestyle of Daring Do
[03:16.11]I used to be just depressed and messed
[03:18.21]Expressed to impress like a dang contest
[03:20.20]Bang bang, I just rapped a couple of audibles
[03:22.48]Trust me when I say nothing is impossible
[03:25.56]Wait where'd the beat go... ah, oh snap
[03:28.71]Stop

[03:47.01]Keep going
[03:48.36]And never back down
