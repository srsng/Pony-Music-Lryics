[00:29.31]Can you see the li-ight
[00:32.69]In the wi-indow at the top of the sta-airs
[00:37.65]I guess she's up late aga-ain
[00:39.91]Divining mysteries in books she sha-ares
[00:44.61]She puts her assi-istant to bed and
[00:47.80]Casts a glance to reckon the ti-ime
[00:52.11]And pla-ans the da-ay ahe-ead
[00:54.34]With a qui-ill by-y candleli-ight
[00:58.40]And if she's enchanted by a sta-arry sky-y
[01:02.00]Or bewitched by a book aga-ain
[01:05.67]You'd better believe that where-e-ver study le-eads
[01:08.99]She'd never leave behind a frie-end
[01:12.38]She's gotta whole lotta magi-ic
[01:15.98]She's gotta whole lotta magic no-ow
[01:19.62]If she's a little bit crazy-y
[01:23.20]Well this who-ole town is any-yhow
[01:26.78]She's gotta whole lotta magi-ic
[01:30.16]She's gotta whole lotta magic now
[01:34.05]If she's a little bit crazy-y
[01:37.63]Well this who-ole town is anyhow
[01:41.29]Deep black, it turns to blu-u-ue
[01:44.85]As the sunrise sparks a brand new day-y
[01:48.00]She waves as she passes by-y-y
[01:52.06]And I wonder what her letters say-y?
[01:56.37]Ring ring ring, just burn that thing
[01:59.28]Why don't we take a little chariot ri-i-ide
[02:02.88]To where the lessons begun, in the warmth of the su-un
[02:06.58]In the ci-ity on the mountainsi-i-ide
[02:10.10]She's gotta who-ole lotta magi-ic
[02:13.71]She's gotta whole lotta magic no-ow
[02:17.34]If she's a little bit crazy-y
[02:20.92]Well this who-ole town is anyho-o-o-o-ow
[02:24.56]She's gotta whole lotta magi-ic
[02:28.14]She's gotta whole lotta magic now
[02:31.77]If she's a little bit crazy-y
[02:35.35]Well this who-ole town is anyho-o-o-ow
[02:39.64]Like the endless ni-ight of a sister's folly
[02:42.91]Or a hellhound with a broken cha-ain
[02:46.18]For her well la-aid pla-ans, I have admiration
[02:50.29]But if she lets it go and conjures up some inspiration
[02:53.62]We can spend the time together
[02:55.51]in a sunnier locatio-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-on
[03:04.21]Alright
[03:40.32]It's well past closing ti-i-ime
[03:43.93]And the shadow from the window pa-ane
[03:47.79]Flickers sleepily-y-y
[03:51.11]Like her eyes as the i-inkwe-ell dra-ains
[03:55.43]Study's the shuttle of a star-swirled lo-om
[03:59.06]Spinning tapestries in her dre-eams
[04:02.44]I sweep for a while
[04:04.22]And hope for her smi-ile
[04:06.02]I'd love to be the thread that she we-e-e-eaves
[04:09.21]She's gotta whole lotta magi-ic
[04:13.24]Who-ole lotta magic now
[04:16.45]If she-e's a little bit crazy-y
[04:20.06]Well this whole town is anyhow
[04:23.72]She's gotta whole lotta magi-ic
[04:27.30]She's gotta whole lotta magic now
[04:30.83]If she-e's a little bit crazy-y
[04:34.49]Well this who-ole town is anyhow
