Can you see the light
In the window at the top of the stairs
I guess she's up late again
Divining mysteries in books she shares
She puts her assistant to bed and
Casts a glance to reckon the time
And plans the day ahead
With a quill by candlelight
And if she's enchanted by a starry sky
Or bewitched by a book again
You'd better believe that wherever study leads
She'd never leave behind a friend
She's gotta whole lotta magic
She's gotta whole lotta magic now
If she's a little bit crazy
Well this whole town is anyhow
She's gotta whole lotta magic
She's gotta whole lotta magic now
If she's a little bit crazy
Well this whole town is anyhow
Deep black, it turns to blue
As the sunrise sparks a brand new day
She waves as she passes by
And I wonder what her letters say?
Ring ring ring, just burn that thing
Why don't we take a little chariot ride
To where the lessons begun, in the warmth of the sun
In the city on the mountainside
She's gotta whole lotta magic
She's gotta whole lotta magic now
If she's a little bit crazy
Well this whole town is anyhow
She's gotta whole lotta magic
She's gotta whole lotta magic now
If she's a little bit crazy
Well this whole town is anyhow
Like the endless night of a sister's folly
Or a hellhound with a broken chain
For her well laid plans, I have admiration
But if she lets it go and conjures up some inspiration
We can spend the time together
in a sunnier location
Alright
It's well past closing time
And the shadow from the window pane
Flickers sleepily
Like her eyes as the inkwell drains
Study's the shuttle of a starswirled lom
Spinning tapestries in her dreams
I sweep for a while
And hope for her smile
I'd love to be the thread that she weaves
She's gotta whole lotta magic
Whole lotta magic now
If she's a little bit crazy
Well this whole town is anyhow
She's gotta whole lotta magic
She's gotta whole lotta magic now
If she's a little bit crazy
Well this whole town is anyhow
