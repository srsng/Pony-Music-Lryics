It was a dark day
When I lost my faith
Wasn't the pony
I thought I'd be
And it seemed that
No one could relate
There was nothing left for me to see
So I took a walk
To the edge of the town
And thought of leaving it all behind
When I
Saw a little letter
Fall right out of the sky
As a grey mare hovered way up high
I thought I was crazy
When I saw her wave
And then simply fly away
So I opened the letter and looked inside
And what was written made my day
It said
Isn't it great
To be different?
Isn't it wonderful
To be exactly who you are?
When you learn to start
Accepting yourself
You'll become a shining star
I turned around
And I saw her at my door
That cute grey mare
With the walleyed stare
She said, "I've heard you play and sing before
And I heard a sadness I could not bear
I just wanted to tell you
That the hardest thing I've faced
Wasn't the teasing or the pain
It was convincing myself
I wasn't stupid, strange, or lame
And helping others do the same"
These last few years
Flew by just like a blur
I'm now exactly where I should be
And I know I owe it all to her
That beautiful mare who believed in me
Isn't it great
To be different?
Isn't it wonderful
To be exactly who you are?
When you learn to start
Accepting yourself
You'll become a shining star
You'll become a shining star
When you learn to love
Just who you are"
Isn't it great
To be different?
Isn't it wonderful
To be exactly who you are?
When you learn to start
Accepting yourself
Isn't it wonderful~~
Isn't it great~
When you learn to love
Just who you are
