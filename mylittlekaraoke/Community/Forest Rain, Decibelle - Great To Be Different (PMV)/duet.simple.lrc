[00:07.01][P1] It was a da-ark da-ay
[00:09.06][P1] When I lost my faith
[00:13.54][P1] Wasn't the po-ony
[00:14.76][P1] I thought I-I'd be
[00:19.67][P1] And it seemed that
[00:21.14][P1] No one could relate
[00:25.91][P1] There was nothing left for me to-o see
[00:30.53][P1] So I took a walk
[00:34.09][P1] To the edge of the to-o-own
[00:38.18][P1] And thought of leaving it all be-ehind
[00:43.00][P1] When I
[00:44.51][P1] Saw a little letter
[00:45.88][P1] Fa-all right out of the-e sky-y-y
[00:50.79][P1] As a grey mare hovered way u-up high
[00:56.83][P1] I thought I was cra-azy-y
[00:58.88][P1] When I saw her wave
[01:03.31][P1] And then simply fly a-away
[01:09.49][P1] So I opened the letter and looked inside
[01:15.63][P1] And what was written made my-y day
[01:20.45][P1] It said
[01:21.96][P1] Isn't it great
[01:23.28][P1] To-o be differe-e-ent?
[01:28.20][P1] Isn't it wonderful
[01:29.95][P1] To be exactly who you a-are?
[01:34.48][P1] When you learn to sta-art
[01:36.52][P1] Accepting yo-urse-e-elf
[01:40.61][P1] You'll become a shining star
[01:59.17][P1] I turned around
[02:00.63][P1] And I saw her at my door
[02:05.40][P1] That cute grey mare
[02:06.67][P1] With the wall-e-eyed stare
[02:11.64][P1] She said,
[02:12.41][P2]  "I've heard you pla-ay and sing before
[02:17.58][P2] And I heard a sadness I could no-ot bear
[02:23.86][P2] I just wanted to tell you
[02:25.71][P2] That the hardest thing I've fa-a-aced
[02:30.43][P2] Wasn't the teasing or the-e pain
[02:35.35][P2] It was convincing myself
[02:38.47][P2] I wasn't stupid, strange, or la-a-ame
[02:42.75][P2] And helping others do the-e sa-ame"
[03:16.99][P1] These last few years
[03:18.50][P1] Flew by just like a blur
[03:23.32][P1] I'm now exactly where I sho-uld be
[03:29.80][P1] And I kno-ow I o-owe it all to her
[03:35.79][P1] That beautiful mare who believed i-in me
[03:42.27][P1] Isn't it great
[03:42.27][P2] Isn't it great
[03:43.58][P1] To-o be differe-e-ent?
[03:43.58][P2] To-o be differe-e-ent?
[03:48.45][P1] Isn't it wonderful
[03:48.45][P2] Isn't it wonderful
[03:50.20][P1] To be exactly who you a-are?
[03:50.20][P2] To be exactly who you a-are?
[03:54.68][P1] When you learn to sta-art
[03:54.68][P2] When you learn to sta-art
[03:56.68][P1] Accepting yourse-e-elf
[03:56.68][P2] Accepting yourse-e-elf
[04:01.16][P1] You'll become a shini-ing star
[04:04.42][P2] Isn't it wonderful~~
[04:07.49][P1] You'll become a shini-ing star
[04:10.85][P2] Isn't it great~
[04:14.16][P1] When you learn to-o love
[04:14.16][P2] When you learn to-o love
[04:16.31][P1] Just who you a-a-are
[04:16.31][P2] Just who you a-a-are
