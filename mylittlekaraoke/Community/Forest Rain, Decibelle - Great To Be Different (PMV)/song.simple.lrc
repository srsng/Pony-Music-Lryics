[00:07.01]It was a da-ark da-ay
[00:09.06]When I lost my faith
[00:13.54]Wasn't the po-ony
[00:14.76]I thought I-I'd be
[00:19.67]And it seemed that
[00:21.14]No one could relate
[00:25.91]There was nothing left for me to-o see
[00:30.53]So I took a walk
[00:34.09]To the edge of the to-o-own
[00:38.18]And thought of leaving it all be-ehind
[00:43.00]When I
[00:44.51]Saw a little letter
[00:45.88]Fa-all right out of the-e sky-y-y
[00:50.79]As a grey mare hovered way u-up high
[00:56.83]I thought I was cra-azy-y
[00:58.88]When I saw her wave
[01:03.31]And then simply fly a-away
[01:09.49]So I opened the letter and looked inside
[01:15.63]And what was written made my-y day
[01:20.45]It said
[01:21.96]Isn't it great
[01:23.28]To-o be differe-e-ent?
[01:28.20]Isn't it wonderful
[01:29.95]To be exactly who you a-are?
[01:34.48]When you learn to sta-art
[01:36.52]Accepting yo-urse-e-elf
[01:40.61]You'll become a shining star
[01:59.17]I turned around
[02:00.63]And I saw her at my door
[02:05.40]That cute grey mare
[02:06.67]With the wall-e-eyed stare
[02:11.64]She said, "I've heard you pla-ay and sing before
[02:17.58]And I heard a sadness I could no-ot bear
[02:23.86]I just wanted to tell you
[02:25.71]That the hardest thing I've fa-a-aced
[02:30.43]Wasn't the teasing or the-e pain
[02:35.35]It was convincing myself
[02:38.47]I wasn't stupid, strange, or la-a-ame
[02:42.75]And helping others do the-e sa-ame"
[03:16.99]These last few years
[03:18.50]Flew by just like a blur
[03:23.32]I'm now exactly where I sho-uld be
[03:29.80]And I kno-ow I o-owe it all to her
[03:35.79]That beautiful mare who believed i-in me
[03:42.27]Isn't it great
[03:43.58]To-o be differe-e-ent?
[03:48.45]Isn't it wonderful
[03:50.20]To be exactly who you a-are?
[03:54.68]When you learn to sta-art
[03:56.68]Accepting yourse-e-elf
[04:01.16]You'll become a shini-ing star
[04:07.49]You'll become a shini-ing star
[04:14.16]When you learn to-o love
[04:16.31]Just who you a-a-are
