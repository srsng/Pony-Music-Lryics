[00:29.75]Hello again~, did you really think you had me gone?
[00:33.50]Hah, you know there is a place for every right you wrong
[00:37.37]You thought your dreams would keep you far away from me
[00:40.83]But I've been hearing your dead quiet plea, yeah
[00:44.41]No, you're never coming out again-
[00:46.95]Don't be so sure
[00:48.50]You've heard me knocking on the other side of every door
[00:52.37]I have been lurking far too deep within for you to see
[00:55.89]But believe me now
[00:57.74]I am coming free
[01:14.35]It is true you have been lurking far within my soul
[01:17.81]But you're in trouble now, I see you only 'cause you roll
[01:21.74]You've had the best of me now for far too many years
[01:25.66]But I'm growing stronger
[01:27.27]I know your fears
[01:28.54]Hah
[01:29.35]You really think you got me there, well bless your soul
[01:33.04]I've been doing this ever since you were a foal
[01:36.74]I bet you're thinking there's something here that you can do
[01:40.37]But your trying is pathetic
[01:41.93]We will never be through
[01:58.89]Your confidence alludes you
[02:00.68]And you know that it's true
[02:02.58]You keep on pulling the same tricks
[02:04.89]And never think I'll learn
[02:07.20]You're reigning ever shorter terms
[02:09.10]And I can feel your grasp
[02:10.49]It's fading just like all your dust into the blue~~~
[03:06.45]You can try to fight me but I will always win
[03:10.89]You're getting far too cheeky
[03:12.74]You know I cannot lose
[03:14.58]Your mind it will be mine
[03:16.20]Just like all the other times
[03:18.27]You claimed me many times before, that much is true
[03:21.56]But I start to wonder is it I who beat you?
[03:25.66]How dare you even say that
[03:27.27]I'm the one who rules
[03:29.12]I've been tying down your heart and mind
[03:31.25]And wore them as my shoes
[03:33.04]Yet here I stand again and I'm already renewed
[03:36.74]Face it, you're the one who keeps on failing
[03:40.20]I've been tearing at your soul
[03:41.87]For more than twenty years
[03:43.89]I've been beating on your mind
[03:45.68]Just to drown you in your fears
[03:47.58]You get weaker everytime I fight, and I get strong
[03:51.45]I'm the ruler of my heart and mind
[03:53.58]You're the one who's always been wrong
[03:57.91]You're mine
[03:58.83]You're mine
[03:59.75]You're mine
[04:00.68]You're mine
[04:01.60]You're mine
[04:02.52]You're mine
[04:03.50]You're mine
[04:04.37]You're mine
[04:05.29]You're mine
