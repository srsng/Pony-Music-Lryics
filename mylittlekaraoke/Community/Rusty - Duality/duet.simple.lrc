[00:29.75][P1] Hello again~, did you really think you had me gone?
[00:33.50][P1] Hah, you know there is a place for every right you wrong
[00:37.37][P1] You thought your dreams would keep you far away from me
[00:40.83][P1] But I've been hearing your dead quiet plea, yeah
[00:44.41][P2] No, you're never coming out again-
[00:46.89][P1] Don't be so sure
[00:48.50][P1] You've heard me knocking on the other side of every door
[00:52.37][P1] I have been lurking far too deep within for you to see
[00:55.89][P1] But believe me now
[00:57.74][P1] I am coming free
[01:14.35][P2] It is true you have been lurking far within my soul
[01:17.81][P2] But you're in trouble now, I see you only 'cause you roll
[01:21.74][P2] You've had the best of me now for far too many years
[01:25.66][P2] But I'm growing stronger
[01:27.27][P2] I know your fears
[01:28.54][P1] Hah
[01:29.35][P1] You really think you got me there, well bless your soul
[01:33.04][P1] I've been doing this ever since you were a foal
[01:36.74][P1] I bet you're thinking there's something here that you can do
[01:40.37][P1] But your trying is pathetic
[01:41.93][P1] We will never be through
[01:58.89][P2] Your confidence alludes you
[02:00.68][P2] And you know that it's true
[02:02.58][P2] You keep on pulling the same tricks
[02:04.89][P2] And never think I'll learn
[02:07.20][P2] You're reigning ever shorter terms
[02:09.04][P2] And I can feel your grasp
[02:10.49][P2] It's fading just like all your dust into the blue~~~
[03:06.45][P1] You can try to fight me but I will always win
[03:10.89][P1] You're getting far too cheeky
[03:12.74][P1] You know I cannot lose
[03:14.58][P1] Your mind it will be mine
[03:16.20][P1] Just like all the other times
[03:18.27][P2] You claimed me many times before, that much is true
[03:21.56][P2] But I start to wonder is it I who beat you?
[03:25.66][P1] How dare you even say that
[03:27.27][P1] I'm the one who rules
[03:29.12][P1] I've been tying down your heart and mind
[03:31.20][P1] And wore them as my shoes
[03:33.04][P2] Yet here I stand again and I'm already renewed
[03:36.74][P2] Face it, you're the one who keeps on failing
[03:40.20][P1] I've been tearing at your soul
[03:41.81][P1] For more than twenty years
[03:43.89][P1] I've been beating on your mind
[03:45.68][P1] Just to drown you in your fears
[03:47.58][P2] You get weaker everytime I fight, and I get strong
[03:51.45][P2] I'm the ruler of my heart and mind
[03:53.58][P2] You're the one who's always been wrong
[03:57.91][P1] You're mine
[03:58.83][P1] You're mine
[03:59.75][P1] You're mine
[04:00.68][P1] You're mine
[04:01.60][P1] You're mine
[04:02.52][P1] You're mine
[04:03.50][P1] You're mine
[04:04.37][P1] You're mine
[04:05.29][P1] You're mine
