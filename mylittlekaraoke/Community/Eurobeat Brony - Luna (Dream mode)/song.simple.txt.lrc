For a thousand years
I've waited here for you
Waited every night
For I thought you were the
Answer to my life
Days turned into years
And into centuries
Patience had to fade
Don't you see that there is
Vengeance in my eyes?
Luna won't you cry for me
I'm as lonely as I've ever been
I am forced back into the start
Is there any way to fix a broken heart?
Infinite despise
And endless jealousy
Bottled in my soul
Has erupted as I'm
Tearing through the skies
Days turned into years
And into centuries
Patience had to fade
Don't you see that there is
Vengeance in my eyes?
Luna won't you cry for me
I'm as lonely as I've ever been
I am forced back into the start
Is there any way to fix a broken heart?
