[01:26.61][P1] When winter snow falls
[01:28.64][P1] In the cold of night
[01:32.69][P1] And the sta-ars begin to glow
[01:35.09][P1] Bathing us in li-i-i-ight
[01:39.25][P1] A flickering glimpse
[01:40.71][P1] A gla-a-ance into-o-o their glo-o-o-ow
[01:45.36][P1] We begi-in to se-e the shadows
[01:48.59][P1] Of the life we'll ne-ever know
[01:52.56][P2] We see the mem'ry
[01:54.85][P2] Of a life we ne-ever lived
[01:58.90][P2] And of those shooting stars
[02:01.41][P2] Of loved ones we sti-ill mi-iss
[02:05.13][P2] We'll never tell them
[02:06.96][P2] Whispers of the lives
[02:08.28][P1] Oh, the ones they left behind
[02:11.05][P2] Whispers of the souls they never knew
[02:17.31][P1] Watching as your children grew
[02:17.31][P2] Watching as your children grew
[02:23.69][P1] Calling out your name befo-ore the fa-all
[02:23.69][P2] Calling out your name befo-ore the fa-all
[02:29.54][P1] And crying out but always standing ta-all
[02:29.54][P2] And crying out but always standing ta-all
[02:36.25][P1] Wishing yo-u were here to see it all
[02:36.25][P2] Wishing yo-u were here to see it all
[02:41.84][P1] Ah ah, come back to me-e
[02:41.84][P2] Ah ah, come back to me-e
[02:48.14][P1] Ah ah, come home to me-e
[02:48.14][P2] Ah ah, come home to me-e
[02:54.44][P1] Ah ah, I miss you so-o
[02:54.44][P2] Ah ah, I miss you so-o
[02:59.91][P1] Ple-ase co-ome ho-o-ome
[02:59.91][P2] Ple-ase co-ome ho-o-ome
[03:13.41][P2] Well we've been through many trials
[03:16.98][P2] But we stuck to all our roots
[03:20.24][P2] We've worked those many ho-urs
[03:23.69][P2] Taken all the fruits
[03:27.25][P2] We've tried so hard and worked
[03:29.61][P2] From day to da-ay to day
[03:32.76][P2] But we'll never know how proud you are
[03:35.88][P2] No matter how we pra-ay
[03:40.00][P1] But when night turns to day
[03:42.33][P1] I feel I'm no-ot alone
[03:45.70][P1] Without my family by my side
[03:48.66][P1] I would be on my own
[03:52.30][P1] And when the winter sno-ow melts
[03:54.81][P1] And the flowers sta-art to bloom
[03:58.26][P1] The tears upon my face will fade and dry
[04:04.30][P1] And fill our lonely spirits with your pri-ide
[04:04.30][P2] And fill our lonely spirits with your pri-ide
[04:11.01][P1] Calling out your name befo-ore the fa-all
[04:11.01][P2] Calling out your name befo-ore the fa-all
[04:16.94][P1] And crying out but always standing ta-all
[04:16.94][P2] And crying out but always standing ta-all
[04:23.65][P1] Wishing you were here to see it all
[04:23.65][P2] Wishing you were here to see it all
[04:29.16][P1] Ah ah, come back to me-e
[04:29.16][P2] Ah ah, come back to me-e
[04:35.50][P1] Ah ah, come home to me-e
[04:35.50][P2] Ah ah, come home to me-e
[04:41.84][P1] Ah ah, I miss you so-o
[04:41.84][P2] Ah ah, I miss you so-o
[04:47.31][P1] Ple-ase co-ome ho-o-ome
[04:47.31][P2] Ple-ase co-ome ho-o-ome
[04:53.61][P1] Ple-ase co-ome ho-o-ome
[04:53.61][P2] Ple-ase co-ome ho-o-ome
[05:02.76][P1] It really breaks my heart to know
[05:05.95][P1] That we are total strangers
[05:09.21][P2] I lived through every single day
[05:12.51][P2] And went through all the dange-ers
[05:15.18][P1] And as time go-es on
[05:18.89][P1] Leading to my end
[05:21.70][P2] It gives me peace to know
[05:24.81][P1] We'll see you aga-a-a-ain
[05:24.81][P2] We'll see you aga-a-a-ain
[05:55.23][P2] Falling from the sky-y, winter calls
[06:01.30][P1] I wish that you were here to see
[06:04.56][P1] The be-auty o-of it all
[06:07.23][P1] Ah ah, come back to me-e
[06:07.23][P2] Ah ah, come back to me-e
[06:13.49][P1] Ah ah, come home to me-e
[06:13.49][P2] Ah ah, come home to me-e
[06:19.75][P1] Ah ah, we love you so-o
[06:19.75][P2] Ah ah, we love you so-o
[06:25.26][P1] Ple-ase co-ome ho-o-ome
[06:33.10][P2] Ho-o-o-ome
[06:37.75][P1] Ple-ase co-ome ho-o-ome
[06:42.59][P1] Ye-e-ah, ye-e-ah
