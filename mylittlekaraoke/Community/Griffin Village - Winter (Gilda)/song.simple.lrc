[00:11.91]I once saw you running from them wha-at did they do to you
[00:18.28]They turned you into a fool, bu-ut you're nobody's fool
[00:24.55]They took something special from you
[00:27.61]Something you would not release
[00:30.82]Shed your tears and let them freeze
[00:33.89]Shed your tears and let them freeze
[00:37.15]They don't know you like I know you all those ponies are the same
[00:43.37]I swear I won't go away, I swear I won't go away
[01:44.16]There is a girl that I know
[01:47.27]Feathers as white as our winter's blanket of snow
[01:51.47]But I know
[01:53.10]But I kno-o-ow
[01:56.56]Her heart is longing for someone to call her own
[02:02.53]But she's all alone
[02:05.89]She's all alo-o-one
[02:34.24]Now the snow is getting heavy won't you please come back with me
[02:40.36]Won't you please come back with me
[02:43.48]Won't you please come back with me
[02:46.64]Won't you please come back with me
[02:49.80]Won't you please come back with me
[02:53.01]Won't you please come back with me
[02:56.17]Won't you please come back with me
