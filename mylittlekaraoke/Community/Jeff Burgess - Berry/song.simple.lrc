[00:32.89]Oh oh oh oh oh
[00:37.22]I know I'll never need an alibi
[00:42.79]I wasn't there 'cause I was too drunk to fly
[00:47.81]Y'all can back me up
[00:50.17]But it may take a plow
[00:53.12]I always join the games
[00:55.57]And I always drop out
[00:59.64]It's a fake...
[01:02.34]It's real...
[01:05.08]It's a fake...
[01:07.87]It's real!~!
[01:10.65]Berry, I'd marry you if I could stand
[01:16.18]Berry, I'd carry you to places across the land
[01:21.28]It's scary how I can't tell my feet from my hands
[01:26.47]If I wasn't too drunk right now
[01:30.45]I'd sing 'til I got banned
[01:34.78]Wow oh oh oh oh

[01:53.77]Do you ever feel your feelings feel too magnified?
[01:59.68]Ever right to say something, it don't come out tried?
[02:04.91]I think the sun is rising
[02:07.52]Is it morning again?
[02:10.31]I always see the start but I never see the end
[02:16.87]It's a fake...
[02:19.61]It's real...
[02:22.35]It's a fake...
[02:25.14]It's real!~!
