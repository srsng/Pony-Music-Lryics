[00:19.30]I’m your stallion in shining amour, my name implies it
[00:22.57]Far from famous, but in bliss, I live, my dreams define it

[01:01.21]When you look my~ wa~~y
[01:04.02]And I know, that you are out of my league
[01:07.97]But you stole my~ heart and gave it away
[01:12.09]I know this isn’t right but these feelings I have won’t go away
[01:17.13]Go away
[01:20.22]Royal Princess with royal duties, a royal pain and
[01:23.48]Everypony, for my hoof, in marriage they campaign and
[01:27.15]I had no idea if my prince I could choose
[01:30.07]Until my heart stopped, when I looked at you~
[01:34.76]But I have checked all the cha~rts
[01:36.54]No way I’m throwing my da~rts
[01:38.48]This stallion’s the perfect one
[01:40.26]My shining second to none

[01:43.98]Whenever he says “Hello!”
[01:45.76]My special somepony
[01:47.19]I’m hoping that you might agree~ ~~~
[01:51.14] When you’re here, I don’t know what to do
[01:55.26]My hopes are fly~ing high
[01:58.24]And when you’re near, I don’t know what to do
[02:02.13]When you look my~ wa~~y
[02:04.94]And I know, that you are out of my league
