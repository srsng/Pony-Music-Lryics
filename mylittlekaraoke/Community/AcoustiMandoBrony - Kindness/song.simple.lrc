[00:24.42]Oh Uh-Whoa
[00:30.41]Oh Uh-Whoa
[00:36.40]Oh Uh-Whoa
[00:42.40]Oh Uh-Whoa
[00:52.88]There's a chance that I could fall
[00:55.60]And no-ot co-ome back
[00:58.69]And never regret a thi-ing
[01:01.50]I'd never get back on tra-ack
[01:04.87]Darkness all around me
[01:07.26]I can't find the light
[01:09.18]I let it all surround me-e
[01:11.70]Giving up without a fight
[01:15.22]The bitterness and pain inside
[01:18.40]Countless tears I had to cry
[01:21.35]I was facing all my fears
[01:24.06]Just to let you in
[01:25.38]To dry my tears, bu-ut
[01:27.76]Your kindness won't betray me
[01:30.71]I feel your heart and soul
[01:33.80]Your kindness still can save me
[01:36.71]I choose to-o not let go
[01:39.80]Stretching out you somehow reach me
[01:42.70]I know this can't be wro-ong
[01:45.84]I'm re-eady won't you teach me
[01:49.07]Your song of ki-indness
[01:55.81]Quiet grace surrou-unds you
[01:58.71]And helps me find my-y own
[02:01.15]I can't tell you how you've helped me
[02:04.75]And how much I have grown
[02:07.14]Even though you're far away
[02:10.14]Inspiration comes from you
[02:12.57]To shine a little brighter every day
[02:16.03]If you only knew
[02:18.38]I will never get upset
[02:20.86]And I will never, ever forget
[02:24.27]The happiness you made me feel
[02:27.08]Almost as if you're actually real, but
[02:32.33]Your kindness won't betray me
[02:35.32]I fe-el your heart and soul
[02:38.13]Your ki-indness sti-ill can save me,
[02:41.22]I choose to-o not let go
[02:44.22]Stretching out you somehow reach me
[02:47.22]I kno-ow this can't be wro-ong
[02:50.31]I'm re-ady, won't you teach me
[02:53.68]Your song of ki-i-indne-ess
[03:23.27]Your kindness won't betray me
[03:26.45]I fe-el your heart and soul
[03:29.26]Your ki-indness still can save me
[03:32.26]In a way you'll neve-er know
[03:35.25]Your kindness won't betray me
[03:38.25]I feel your he-eart and soul
[03:41.25]Your ki-indness still can save me
[03:44.24]I choose to-o not let go
[03:47.29]Stretching out you somehow reach me
[03:50.24]I kno-ow this can't be wro-ong
[03:53.23]I'm re-ady, won't you teach me
[03:56.32]The way to get along
[03:59.22]Even when the cold wind's blo-owing
[04:02.27]And I want to just give i-in
[04:05.31]It warms my heart just kno-owing
[04:08.21]I'll hear your voice a-again
[04:11.30]So wo-on't you sing it loud
[04:14.21]And won't you sing it long
[04:17.20]I pro-omise to remember
[04:20.39]Your song of ki-indne-ess
[04:35.28]I-I promise to-o remembe-e-er
[04:41.27]I promise to-o remember
