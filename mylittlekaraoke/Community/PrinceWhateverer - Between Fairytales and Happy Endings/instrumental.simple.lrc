[00:27.15]I used to be the one
[00:31.54]Stuck on the sidelines
[00:33.52]But lately things have started to~ change
[00:39.94]I would have never thought
[00:43.12]That being the way I am could make
[00:46.76]Everything end up this~~ way
[00:51.94]This is never what I would have expected
[00:54.94]There's nothing wrong but
[00:55.91]They still want me corrected
[00:58.16]Why can't you just let me do what I do
[01:01.42]I'm not hurting anyone so why are you
[01:09.75]Why are you
[01:16.54]How could you try and change who I've always been
[01:19.99]What did I do wrong?
[01:21.71]I never wanted any of this
[01:23.81]I'm sorry if I ever offended any of you
[01:26.96]But I am who I am
[01:28.20]There's not much more that I can do
[01:30.15]A wise man once said that friendship was magic
[01:33.34]The way I see it
[01:34.43]It's been nothing but tragic
[01:36.53]I tried my best and it wasn't quite there
[01:39.75]A fairy tale but no happy ending for this mare?
[02:09.56]I just don't know what went~ wrong
[02:13.54]They don't love me anymore~ so
[02:18.26]So~ long
[02:21.97]Now I'm left out~ on my~ own
[02:26.18]I wish there was somewhere for me
[02:31.12]To call home
[02:34.39]Is it not enough that I'm in the background?
[02:37.50]You wanna drop me because of how my voice sounds?
[02:40.61]Well I apologize if I ever made you sad
[02:43.95]But I will not be sorry for being who I am
[02:51.08]This is who I am~~
[02:58.95]How could you try and change who I've always been
[03:02.44]What did I do wrong?
[03:04.16]I never wanted any of this
[03:06.15]I'm sorry if I ever offended any of you
[03:09.41]But I am who I am
[03:10.65]There's not much more that I can do
[03:12.56]A wise man once said that friendship was magic
[03:15.75]The way I see it
[03:16.76]It's been nothing but tragic
[03:18.94]I tried my best and it wasn't quite there
[03:22.09]A fairy tale but no happy ending for this mare?
[03:50.18]How could you try and change who I've always been
[03:53.47]What did I do wrong?
[03:55.31]I never wanted any of this
[03:57.45]I'm sorry if I ever offended any of you
[04:00.53]But I am who I am
[04:01.76]There's not much more that I can do~
[04:03.79]A wise man once said that friendship was magic
[04:06.86]The way I see it
[04:07.95]It's been nothing but tragic
[04:10.12]I tried my best and it wasn't quite~ there
[04:13.35]So will there ever be a happy ending for this mare?
