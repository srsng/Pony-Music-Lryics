[00:17.10]Another day of cloudy skies
[00:20.85]Feelin' low and I don't know why, I
[00:25.35]Guess it shouldn’t be news to me now
[00:28.67]It's been this way for centuries but I'm holding out
[00:33.11]I heard from legends and crystal balls
[00:36.74]Sun gave warmth to the great and small
[00:41.18]I saw the smile good old Ray put on their face
[00:45.31]It ain’t too much to want gentle grace
[00:49.12]This pessimism brings my brain a schism
[00:52.69]Splitting up my mind
[00:56.63]But I know before too soon, I’ll find
[01:00.75]Footsteps on my porch of ultraviolet kind
[01:04.26]When the sun comes knocking on my door
[01:08.57]And after I pick my jaw off the floor
[01:12.58]I'll say "Come in stranger!"; It's been too long a while
[01:16.70]He'll hang up his hat with a radiant smile
[01:20.77]I'll ask where he's been for all of these years
[01:24.59]We'll talk about his travels over two or three beers
[01:28.65]I'll hang on every word, looking forward to brighter days
[01:34.40]When the sun comes back to stay
[01:52.86]Maybe he just read the sign wrong
[01:56.11]Or fell asleep waiting on his train
[02:00.17]And the galaxy express takes a century no less
[02:04.62]To come back round our way again
[02:08.12]Every one says you're gone, but I know you're only late
[02:12.62]I'll leave the lights on if you reciprocate
[02:16.56]Just promise you're back and we won't get burned
[02:20.06]You'll be the prodigal sun as far as I'm concerned
[02:24.07]When the sun comes knocking on my door
[02:28.63]And after I pick my jaw off the floor
[02:32.57]I'll say "Come on in stranger!"; It's been too long a while
[02:36.64]He'll hang up his hat with a radiant smile~
[02:40.64]I'll ask where he's been for all of these years
[02:44.71]We'll talk about his travels over two or three beers~
[02:48.71]I'll hang on every word, looking forward to brighter days~~
[02:54.34]When the sun comes back~ to staaaaaay~~~~~~~~~~~
[03:13.29]Come on back baby, we miss you
