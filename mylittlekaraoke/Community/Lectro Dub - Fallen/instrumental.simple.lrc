[00:13.82]All of the city
[00:19.87]Turns to black~
[00:22.98]And fades away~
[00:26.52]Oh, dreams~ of the crystal heart~
[00:33.00]Turn into night~mares as it breaks apart~
[00:41.14]Dark~ness has overtaken
[00:46.71]An ancient e~vil has been awa~kened~
[00:55.23]They all expec~ted me~ to sa~ve them
[01:00.37]Who could have guessed~ I would~ have failed~
[01:07.66]After where~ we've been
[01:11.09]Time and time~ again
[01:14.09]We fall
[01:17.52]We let them down and now we're captive just as well~
[01:35.95]Tried so hard, but in the end~
[01:42.00]Lost it all~ anyway~
[01:49.77]All of those who trusted us~
[01:55.77]Locked and caged
[01:58.71]Can't get away~~
[02:03.43]Who's to blame now
[02:05.14]Who's to blame now
[02:06.86]You're to blame now
[02:08.52]You're to blame now
[02:10.29]Who's to blame now
[02:12.00]Who's to blame
[02:13.39]It's you~
[02:15.32]It's you~
[02:17.14]Failed to save us
[02:18.86]Sombra slaved us
[02:20.57]Darkness changed us
[02:22.29]Hate deranged us
[02:24.00]Who's to blame now
[02:25.71]Who's to blame
[02:27.00]It's you~
[02:28.93]It's you~~
[02:44.95]She had a chance to save~ the lives~ of e~veryone
[02:51.16]She held it in her hooves and now it's gone~
[02:58.29]Who designed the minds~ of kings~ to be so cruel
[03:04.87]Who's anger could~ have made this hatred spawn~
[03:12.00]Might as well just give myself away~
[03:15.75]I'm not the one to save them
[03:18.86]Trust in what I could have been
[03:21.80]I will not let you down this time~
[03:25.71]Sombra's darkness crystalizing
[03:29.14]Friendships made are now dividing
[03:32.62]Hypnotizing, paralyzing
[03:36.00]Harmony destabilizing
[03:39.43]Damn myself and give away what's left of me
[03:44.30]A sacrifice to save the ones I love so dearly
[03:49.71]Hold me as the end grows closer
[03:53.14]Chained up to this crystal prison
[03:56.57]Weighing on my last decision
[04:00.05]Feed me to the entity~ of hate~~
