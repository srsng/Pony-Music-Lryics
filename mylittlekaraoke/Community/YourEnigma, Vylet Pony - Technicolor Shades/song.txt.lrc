My world was still in hues of black and white
But the way~ that you move won't let me sleep at night~~
You're shakin' me up
Won't leave me alone
Let's calm these nerves~
Throw this dog a bone~ and we can~
And take a toke
Make a move
Nice and slow
I'll let you choose~
How fast we go
Help me see in technicolor
Well hold your breath
And wipe your eyes
While we decompress
I'll let you choose~
How fast we go
Let me see in technicolor~
You help me~ see in technicolor shades
In technicolor shades~
You help me~ see~ in technicolor shades
In technicolor shades~
Woo oh~
