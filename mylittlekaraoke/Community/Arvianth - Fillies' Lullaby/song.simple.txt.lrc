Good night, my fellow ponies
For I shall guard your dreams
Until the moonlight lowers
You're safe from troubles life can bring
Close your eyes, leave behind
Worries, griefs and fears
Listen to twinkling stars
Whispers of the summer wind
Night may not be light and bright
Like my sister's day
But it can take you far away
To heart's desired place
Hush, my little ponies
Catch your sweetest dreams
Fly amid the planets
Drift in starry streams
Fear you not, I'll be there
Shall the nightmares come
Lay to rest~, be well prepared
To meet the sun at dawn
Night may not be light and bright
Like my sister's day
But it can take you far away
To heart's desired lands
