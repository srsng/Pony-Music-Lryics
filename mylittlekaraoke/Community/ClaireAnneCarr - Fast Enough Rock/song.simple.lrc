[00:26.58]The wind ruffling my mane
[00:29.58]The speed, the sky, the rain
[00:32.58]I still feel them constantly
[00:36.58]When we're together
[00:38.25]Sometimes, yes, it's tough
[00:40.58](but I) Can't rush fast enough
[00:43.92]To stand by your side forever...
[00:47.67]Oh Rainbow...
[01:34.67]Fears and threats
[01:35.75]Don't worry, defeat them
[01:37.50]Lies, regrets
[01:38.58]Forget those, outwit them
[01:40.33]Can't you see all that
[01:41.92]Really matters is you and me?
[01:46.00]Rainbow streams
[01:47.00]And apples are turning
[01:48.83]Honesty
[01:49.83]Loyalty returning
[01:51.67]If friendship is magic
[01:53.58]Imagine what love can be
[02:53.75]Family an' sky above
[02:56.17]The land Ah know and love
[02:59.42](Ah) always see them in your eyes
[03:03.42]When we're together
[03:05.00]Diamond in the rough

[03:10.67]To stand by you, forever
[03:16.33]Fears and threats
[03:17.42]Don't worry, defeat them
[03:19.17]Lies, regrets
