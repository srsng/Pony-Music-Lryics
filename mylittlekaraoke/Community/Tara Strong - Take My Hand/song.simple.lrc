[00:04.62]Sometimes I feel like no-othin'
[00:06.48]Mmm mmm
[00:08.94]I like to think of us and
[00:10.79]Mmm mmm
[00:13.12]You know that shadows always fa-ade
[00:17.63]Open your heart
[00:21.81]That's where we start
[00:25.59]Take my hand
[00:27.98]And we can walk together
[00:29.84]'Cross this land
[00:32.16]Of places we've been never
[00:34.15]I can't stand
[00:36.47]When darkness takes your light away
[00:40.72]I'm here no matter what they say
[00:51.34]Some need to speak like tigers
[00:53.66]Try to scratch your soul
[00:55.62]I like to soar like gliders
[00:57.71]And get you feelin' whole
[01:00.06]I get all your crazy wa-ays
[01:04.37]Open your heart
[01:08.55]That's where we start
[01:12.34]Take my hand
[01:14.73]And we can walk together
[01:16.55]'Cross this land
[01:18.91]Of places we've been never
[01:20.90]I can't stand
[01:23.22]When darkness takes your light away
[01:27.50]I'm here no matter what they say
[01:33.54]Only yo-ur eyes can see
[01:37.52]Light start to shine
[01:42.06]I hear your song and your heart
[01:47.21]Mixed with mine
[01:50.52]Take my hand
[01:52.91]And we can walk together
[01:54.80]'Cross this land
[01:57.16]Of places we've been never
[01:59.02]I can't stand
[02:01.41]When darkness takes your light away
[02:05.72]I'm here no matter what they say
[02:09.90]We'll sing our melody our way
[02:14.15]Together everything's okay
