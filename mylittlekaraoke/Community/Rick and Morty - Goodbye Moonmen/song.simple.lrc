[00:00.40]Thank you Morty
[00:01.40]You are not like other carbon-based life forms
[00:03.95]You put the value of all life above your own
[00:06.30]It's how things should be
[00:07.70]It's how they could be
[00:08.95]I could not agree more
[00:11.30]The world can be one together
[00:13.90]Cosmos without hatred
[00:17.05]Stars like diamonds in your eyes
[00:24.05]The ground can be space~, space~, space~, space, space
[00:29.40]With feet marching towards a peaceful sky
[00:36.25]All the Moonmen want things their way~
[00:42.20]But we make sure~ they see the~ sun
[00:48.70]Goodbye~ Moon~men~
[00:54.35]We~ say Goodbye Moon~men~
[01:01.00]Goodbye
[01:02.65]Shut the f- up about Moonmen!
[01:04.40]This isn't a musical number
[01:05.75]This is a f---ing operation
[01:07.35]We got to be cool and f---ing lay low
