[00:11.35]And into her own reflection, she stared
[00:15.29]Yearning for one whose reflection she shared
[00:19.01]And solemnly sweared not to be scared
[00:22.95]At the prospect of being doubly mared...
[00:41.29]Ancient urban legends
[00:43.04]Of a time and place long ago~
[00:46.81]A long lost cavern whe~re
[00:48.74]Nopony has dared to go~
[00:51.62]A bright mirror surface
[00:54.25]Shows the gaze of your own eyes
[00:57.23]To tamper with mystic powers
[00:59.86]Is most certainly unwi~se
[01:03.01]Step into the water
[01:05.46]And wash your fear awa~y
[01:08.44]And make sure that you're polite as can be
[01:11.06]When yourself comes out to play
[01:13.95]You've unleashed yourself upon the world
[01:16.75]And no matter how hard you try~
[01:19.73]The legends have led you to~ create
[01:22.36]A picture perfect lie~
[01:37.24]A mystery fairy ta~le
[01:39.26]Passed down from ea~r to ear
[01:42.94]The terrified townsfolk are all
[01:45.21]Shrinking ba~ck in fea~r
[01:48.01]What have you done?
[01:50.47]Your intention was since~re
[01:53.27]But it's all gone so wrong
[01:56.07]And you shed yourself a~ tea~r
[01:59.22]Sink into the water
[02:01.67]And wash your fears awa~y
[02:04.65]And make sure that you're polite as can be
[02:07.28]When yourself comes out to play
[02:10.08]You've unleashed yourself upon the world
[02:12.88]And no matter how hard you cry
[02:15.86]You can't go back, for the damage is done
[02:18.48]And oh, the end is ni~gh!
[02:44.23]Block the cave, and never return
[02:46.59]Tell them all to stay a~wa~y
[02:49.48]'Cause that ancient legend caused far too much
[02:52.28]Of misery and disma~y
[02:55.26]You'll never make that mista~ke again
[02:57.80]No, you'll certainly never try~
[03:00.86]The memories will haunt you forever
[03:03.53]When you told yourself goodbye~!
[03:20.22]And into her own reflection, she stared
[03:23.94]Remembering those whose reflection she shared
[03:27.75]And solemnly sweared that for those whom she cared
[03:31.69]She would savor the time her life had spared...
