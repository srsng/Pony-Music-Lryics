[00:00.79]I
[00:04.79]I fall~ to my~ knees
[00:13.86]And your sun~
[00:17.85]Broke through~ me
[00:27.78]I never knew I'd been asleep
[00:37.35]You
[00:41.20]You parted the clouds~
[00:45.34]Over me
[00:50.34]And I'm baptised~
[00:53.55]In your~ ho~ly~ light
[01:01.55]And you brought me back to life
[01:13.26]In a prison of ice I lived my life in~ pain
[01:20.40]Just waiting to~ be un~~chained
[01:29.89]Oh I owe you everything
[01:50.39]Since that~ day I~ can't control~
[01:57.81]What you do~ to me
[02:03.88]It feels~ like
[02:07.31]I'm losing my~ mind
[02:27.01]Beneath your sun
[02:28.73]I'm burning alive in your light~
[02:33.58]And tonight I'll breath
[02:37.87]In your red fire~~
[02:45.29]Into the flame
[02:47.00]A~gain and again and your light~
[02:51.86]Will split the night and
[02:54.50]Rain down
[02:58.43]Red fire~~
[03:27.06]I feel it
[03:28.42]It burns~
[03:29.63]Beneath my skin
[03:32.98]The hunger demands to feed
[03:38.70]From purity to sin
[03:42.20]The want~ turns into a need~~
[03:51.33]It wa~shes over me~
[03:54.40]I become
[03:55.83]I learn
[03:56.97]I'm a slave to the burn
[04:00.47]It brings me to my knees~
[04:09.90]Oh I beg~ you~ please
[04:39.24]It comes in waves
[04:41.53]It cuts through the haze
[04:43.60]And I feel the walls
[04:46.38]Fall down around me
[04:48.74]Crushed and lost
[04:50.74]But who knows the cost
[04:52.74]I'd sell my soul
[04:55.02]To set my world on fire~~
[05:06.94]Beneath your sun
[05:08.73]I'm burning alive in your light~
[05:13.58]And tonight I'll breath
[05:17.87]In your red fire~~
[05:25.29]Into the flame
[05:27.01]Again and again and your light~
[05:31.79]Will split the night and
[05:34.50]Rain down
[05:38.43]Red fire~~
[05:43.00]I run and I run
[05:45.29]But I just can't escape
[05:47.64]The sight~~
[05:50.14]Of endless light
[05:52.14]I need your
[05:56.78]Red fire~~
[06:01.35]We shed these chains
[06:03.56]And forget our names
[06:05.63]As the light~~~
[06:08.42]Consumes the night and
[06:11.06]Bleeds out
[06:14.99]Red fire~~
