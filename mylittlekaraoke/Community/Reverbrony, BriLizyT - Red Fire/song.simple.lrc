[00:02.95]I
[00:06.95]I fall~ to my~ knees
[00:16.01]And your sun~
[00:20.01]Broke through~ me
[00:29.94]I never knew I'd been asleep
[00:39.50]You
[00:43.36]You parted the clouds~
[00:47.50]Over me
[00:52.50]And I'm baptised~
[00:55.71]In your~ ho~ly~ light
[01:03.71]And you brought me back to life
[01:15.42]In a prison of ice I lived my life in~ pain
[01:22.56]Just waiting to~ be un~~chained
[01:32.05]Oh I owe you everything
[01:52.54]Since that~ day I~ can't control~
[01:59.97]What you do~ to me
[02:06.04]It feels~ like
[02:09.47]I'm losing my~ mind
[02:29.17]Beneath your sun
[02:30.89]I'm burning alive in your light~
[02:35.74]And tonight I'll breath
[02:40.02]In your red fire~~
[02:47.45]Into the flame
[02:49.16]A~gain and again and your light~
[02:54.02]Will split the night and
[02:56.66]Rain down
[03:00.59]Red fire~~
[03:29.22]I feel it
[03:30.57]It burns~
[03:31.79]Beneath my skin
[03:35.14]The hunger demands to feed
[03:40.86]From purity to sin
[03:44.35]The want~ turns into a need~~
[03:53.49]It wa~shes over me~
[03:56.56]I become
[03:57.99]I learn
[03:59.13]I'm a slave to the burn
[04:02.63]It brings me to my knees~
[04:12.06]Oh I beg~ you~ please
[04:41.40]It comes in waves
[04:43.69]It cuts through the haze
[04:45.76]And I feel the walls
[04:48.54]Fall down around me
[04:50.90]Crushed and lost
[04:52.90]But who knows the cost
[04:54.90]I'd sell my soul
[04:57.18]To set my world on fire~~
[05:09.10]Beneath your sun
[05:10.89]I'm burning alive in your light~
[05:15.74]And tonight I'll breath
[05:20.03]In your red fire~~
[05:27.45]Into the flame
[05:29.17]Again and again and your light~
[05:33.95]Will split the night and
[05:36.66]Rain down
[05:40.59]Red fire~~
[05:45.16]I run and I run
[05:47.44]But I just can't escape
[05:49.80]The sight~~
[05:52.30]Of endless light
[05:54.30]I need your
[05:58.94]Red fire~~
[06:03.51]We shed these chains
[06:05.72]And forget our names
[06:07.79]As the light~~~
[06:10.58]Consumes the night and
[06:13.22]Bleeds out
[06:17.15]Red fire~~
