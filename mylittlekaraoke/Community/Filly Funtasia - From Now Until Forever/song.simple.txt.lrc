From now until forever, away
Ay, ay, ay
Me and you
You and me
Nothing's ever gonna get inbetween
What we got
What we have
We know that it's built to last
Oh yeah
So get the music goin'
'Cause today we're knowin'
From now on right here, right now
There is no more waitin'
We'll be celebratin'
Here we go
Oh, oh, oh
From now until forever
We'll be together, I can't wait
From now until forever and away
Eh, eh, eh
