From no-ow until forever, a-away
Ay, ay, ay
Me and you
You and me
Nothing's ever gonna get in-between
What we got
What we have
We know that it's built to last
Oh yeah
So get the music goin'
'Cause today we're knowin'
From now on right here, right now
There is no more waitin'
We'll be celebratin'
Here we go
Oh, oh, oh
From no-ow until forever
We'll be together, I can't wait
From no-ow until forever and a-away
Eh, eh, eh
