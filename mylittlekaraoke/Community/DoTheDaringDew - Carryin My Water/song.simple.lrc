[00:10.07]Carryin' my water
[00:11.86]My water, my wa~ter
[00:14.07]Carryin' my water
[00:16.03]On my shoulder pole
[00:18.07]Carryin' my water
[00:19.82]My water, my wa~ter
[00:22.03]Carryin' my water
[00:24.03]On my shoulder pole
[00:26.03]Manehattan, back to Ponyville
[00:27.86]The path is laid out for~ me
[00:30.03]Got my buckets of water filled
[00:32.07]My delivery
[00:33.86]The road ahead is long
[00:35.53]And it's dangerous and sca~ry
[00:38.07]But I'll just keep singin' this song
[00:40.03]Free of all wary
[00:41.82]I know to keep moving on
[00:43.86]Don't need no train or fee
[00:45.90]I know from the break of dawn
[00:47.82]Celestia watches me
[00:50.28]That's why I'm
[00:51.07]Carryin' my water
[00:52.86]My water, my wa~ter
[00:55.07]Carryin' my water
[00:57.03]On my shoulder pole
[00:59.07]Carryin' my water
[01:00.86]My water, my wa~ter
[01:03.07]Carryin' my water
[01:05.07]On my shoulder pole
[01:06.90]I made my way through a small town
[01:08.86]Where I was greeted evenly
[01:11.03]Smiles were all around
[01:12.57]I was welcomed equally
[01:14.78]In the mountains I met a buffalo
[01:16.82]He looked so sad and all alone
[01:18.86]I said "don't hang your head so low
[01:20.82]I'm also far from home"
[01:22.86]I told him "No need to grunt
[01:24.82]Just get back on track"
[01:26.86]I told him "A hoof in front
[01:28.94]Eventually leads you back"
[01:31.32]I'll keep onâ€¦
[01:32.07]Carryin' my water
[01:33.86]My water, my wa~ter
[01:35.98]Carryin' my water
[01:38.03]On my shoulder pole
[01:40.07]Carryin' my water
[01:41.86]My water, my wa~ter
[01:44.07]Carryin' my water
[01:46.03]On my shoulder pole
[01:48.03]I'll keep on singin' this tune~
[01:51.07]With a smile on my face~
[01:53.61]I'll be home very soon~
[01:56.36]Just gotta keep up the Snails pace
[02:06.57]Na na na na na na
[02:08.36]Na na na na na na na
[02:10.57]Na na na na na na
[02:12.40]Na na na na na na
[02:14.57]Canterlot was great
[02:16.03]I could see my house from up on high
[02:18.40]And there across the way
[02:19.90]The winged city in the sky
[02:22.53]Home sweet home at last
[02:24.07]Ponyville needs a refreshing drink
[02:26.40]My journey was a blast
[02:28.11]It was over in a blink
[02:30.36]It's great to finally be done
[02:32.36]And see my home again
[02:34.32]It's great to think about it none
[02:36.36]And finally call it in
[02:39.28]I'm now done
[02:40.07]Carryin' my water
[02:41.86]My water, my wa~ter
[02:44.07]Carryin' my water
[02:46.03]On my shoulder pole
[02:48.07]Carryin' my water
[02:49.86]My water, my wa~ter
[02:52.03]Carryin' my water
[02:54.07]On my shoulder pole
[02:56.03]On my shoulder pole
[02:58.03]On my shoulder pole
[03:00.03]On my shoulder pole~~
[03:02.11]On my shoulder pole
