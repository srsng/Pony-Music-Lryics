[02:31.66]Dusk falls~, howls in the dark
[02:39.96]Evil comes out to~~ play
[02:48.31]Disappear within our~ caves
[02:55.88]As prey, we hide~ a~way
[03:09.62]As the months drag on
[03:17.97]Our old life is gone
[03:26.20]Destinies are drawn
[03:33.14] Of freezing dawn~
[03:37.88]Just keep on walking~, and don't look back
[03:45.37]Just keep your eyes forward and stay on track
[03:53.64]We'll find a way out of this mess, I pray
[04:01.99]As long as the spirits guide our way
[04:10.99]Just keep on walking~, and don't look back
[04:18.44]Just keep your eyes forward and stay on track
[04:26.75]We'll find a way out of this mess, I pray
[04:35.10]As long as the spirits guide our way
