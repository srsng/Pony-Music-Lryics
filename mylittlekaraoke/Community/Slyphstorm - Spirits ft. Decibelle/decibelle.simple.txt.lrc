Dusk falls~, howls in the dark
Evil comes out to~~ play
Disappear within our~ caves
As prey, we hide~ a~way
As the months drag on
Our old life is gone
Destinies are drawn
Of freezing dawn~
Just keep on walking~, and don't look back
Just keep your eyes forward and stay on track
We'll find a way out of this mess, I pray
As long as the spirits guide our way
Just keep on walking~, and don't look back
Just keep your eyes forward and stay on track
We'll find a way out of this mess, I pray
As long as the spirits guide our way
