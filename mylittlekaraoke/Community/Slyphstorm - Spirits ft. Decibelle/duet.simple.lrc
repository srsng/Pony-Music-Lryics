[00:44.05][P1] Wind blows~ across this wasteland
[00:52.36][P1] No~ one here~ to~ see
[01:00.75][P1] I~ stand here by~ my~self
[01:08.16][P1] Except when you're~ with me
[01:17.24][P1] Days and days~~ go by~
[01:25.47][P1] Un~der the bur~ning~~ sky~
[01:33.82][P1] No matter how~~ we cry~~
[01:42.01][P1] Never can we~ answer why
[01:50.32][P1] Just keep on walking~, and don't~ look back
[01:57.77][P1] Just~ keep your eyes forward and~ stay~ on track
[02:06.08][P1] We'll find a way out~ of~ this mess~~, I pray
[02:14.42][P1] As~~ long as the spirits guide~ our~ way
[02:31.66][P2] Dusk falls~, howls in the dark
[02:39.96][P2] Evil comes out to~~ play
[02:48.31][P2] Disappear within our~ caves
[02:55.88][P2] As prey, we hide~ a~way
[03:04.85][P1] Days and days~~ go by~
[03:09.62][P2] As the months drag on
[03:13.08][P1] Un~der the bur~ning~~ sky~
[03:17.97][P2] Our old life is gone
[03:21.38][P1] No matter how~~ we try~~
[03:26.20][P2] Destinies are drawn
[03:29.65][P1] With the ri~sing of free~zing dawn~
[03:33.14][P2]  Of freezing dawn~
[03:37.88][P1] Just keep on walking~, and don't~ look back
[03:37.88][P2] Just keep on walking~, and don't look back
[03:45.37][P1] Just~ keep your eyes forward and~ stay~ on track
[03:45.37][P2] Just keep your eyes forward and stay on track
