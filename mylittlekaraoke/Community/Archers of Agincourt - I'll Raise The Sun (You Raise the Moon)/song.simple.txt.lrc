So~me nights I wa~ke up and I
See the mo~on and I see
Swir~ling galaxies and I
Think of you
Somewhere up there's a frie~~~~nd
A friend I lost long ago~~~~~~~
Sometimes I wonder if you see me too~~~~
When I raise the sun up for you
When I raise the su~n up for you~
Lo~ng have I waited
For your moon to shine
And now~ you're ba~ck with me~
After all this ti~~me
Where do we go now from he~~~~re?
It's been a thousand ye~~~~~~ars
Can we go back to what it used to be~?
When you raised the moon up for me~~?
When you raised the moon up for me~~~
O~h Sister, I've been so ti~red
Of singing sad so~ngs
And of... being alone
But now you
Have to choose to recei~~~~~~~ve
The friendship before you I lea~ve
I'll raise the sun up for you
You raise the moon up for me
I'll raise the sun up for you
You raise the moon up for me
I'll raise the sun up for you
If you raise the moon up for me
