[00:46.75]Play the guitar~
[00:50.05]Play it again~, my pone
[00:56.11]Maybe I'm cold
[00:59.28]But at least you're safe I think
[01:06.03]There is no other mare
[01:09.39]Like this unicorn
[01:12.97]The one that they call
[01:16.65]Lyra Heart~strings
[01:23.87]Play it again, Lyra Heartstrings~~
[01:36.45]Whether you go
[01:39.94]Whether you stay
[01:42.97]Bring friendship~
[01:46.75]Life can be cruel
[01:49.87]But we can be kind I think
[01:56.58]There is no talking horse
[01:59.88]As green unicorn
[02:03.56]The one that they call
[02:07.29]Lyra Heart~strings
[02:14.23]Play it again, Lyra Heart~strings~~
