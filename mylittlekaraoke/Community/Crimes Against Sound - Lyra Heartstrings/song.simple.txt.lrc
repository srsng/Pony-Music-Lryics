Play the guitar~
Play it again~, my pone
Maybe I'm cold
But at least you're safe I think
There is no other mare
Like this unicorn
The one that they call
Lyra Heart~strings
Play it again, Lyra Heartstrings~~
Whether you go
Whether you stay
Bring friendship~
Life can be cruel
But we can be kind I think
There is no talking horse
As green unicorn
The one that they call
Lyra Heart~strings
Play it again, Lyra Heart~strings~~
