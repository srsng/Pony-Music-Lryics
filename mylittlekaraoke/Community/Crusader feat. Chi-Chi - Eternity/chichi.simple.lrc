[00:46.00]…move on yet
[00:49.26] …I could regret
[01:12.36]My breath stolen when we first met
[01:16.11]At first glance, my mi-ind still wasn't set
[01:19.30]But I knew
[01:21.21]That your smile lit the-e world
[01:26.95]When you first held me in our first dance
[01:30.89]My heart would race while I was in a trance
[01:34.64]I'd make it last forever if I-I could
[01:41.76]I would always be by your si-ide
[01:45.33]The only oath I could abi-ide
[01:50.88]They say few things are worth waiting forever more
[01:54.70]And forever's too good to be true
[01:59.65]Few things ever change, I know that is true
[02:03.36]Because I will always love you
[02:17.65]I don't want this, but I guess it's time
[02:27.14]Goodbye, goodbye
[02:34.53]Goodbye, go-odbye
[02:41.91]Goodbye, go-odbye
[02:49.30]Goodbye, go-odbye
[02:52.94]Goodby-y-ye
[03:03.59]And that just might be-e true
[03:15.48]I’ll wait forever for you
