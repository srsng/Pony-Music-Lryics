My breath stolen from such a night
Staying awake only for this sight
How would these stars look reflected in your eyes?
I could dream of soaring just as high
Then wake up with a hopeless sigh
A nightmare is where you're not by my side
Is it time to move on yet?
That's one more thing I could regret
They say few things are worth waiting forever more
You taught me that it's never true
Few things are worth waiting an eternity for
But I'll wait forever for you
…be by your side
…I could aide
Is it about time?
This hardship stays afloat
I won't promise no tears
Wake up in a new world,
I won't promise no fears
This hardship stays afloat
I won't promise no tears
Wake up in a new world,
I won't promise no fears
Goodbye
They say few things are worth mourning forever more
But if there's someone worth waiting an eternity for
I’ll wait forever for you
…move on yet
…I could regret
My breath stolen when we first met
At first glance, my mind still wasn't set
But I knew
That your smile lit the world
When you first held me in our first dance
My heart would race while I was in a trance
I'd make it last forever if I could
I would always be by your side
The only oath I could abide
They say few things are worth waiting forever more
And forever's too good to be true
Few things ever change, I know that is true
Because I will always love you
I don't want this, but I guess it's time
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, godbye
Goodbye, godbye
Goodbye, godbye
Goodbye
And that just might be true
I’ll wait forever for you
