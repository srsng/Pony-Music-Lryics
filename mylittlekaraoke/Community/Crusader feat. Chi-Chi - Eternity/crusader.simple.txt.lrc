My breath stolen from such a night
Staying awake only for this sight
How would these stars look reflected in your eyes?
I could dream of soaring just as high
Then wake up with a hopeless sigh
A nightmare is where you're not by my side
Is it time to move on yet?
That's one more thing I could regret
They say few things are worth waiting forever more
You taught me that it's never true
Few things are worth waiting an eternity for
But I'll wait forever for you
…be by your side
…I could aide
Is it about time?
This hardship stays afloat
I won't promise no tears
Wake up in a new world,
I won't promise no fears
This hardship stays afloat
I won't promise no tears
Wake up in a new world,
I won't promise no fears
Goodbye
They say few things are worth mourning forever more
But if there's someone worth waiting an eternity for
I’ll wait forever for you
