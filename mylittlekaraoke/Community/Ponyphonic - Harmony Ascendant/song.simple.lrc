[00:01.50]It was always very loud back then
[00:05.10]A great agitation issued from the ground itself
[00:09.40]Rising into the air and filling all with discontent and worry
[00:14.80]Beneath us stretched a mad landscape of spots and checkers
[00:19.00]Above twisted a kaleidoscope sky
[00:22.65]And all between was ceaseless, unbroken chaos
[00:31.25]Eventually, we grew callous to the clamor
[00:34.80]And slipped from anxiety into malaise
[00:38.25]Shedding our passion and our purpose
[00:41.70]It was thus that the two great sisters found us
[00:47.35]From somewhere beyond the horizon, they came
[00:50.05]Seeing beauty amidst the bedlam
[00:52.85]They took up our sad world between them and tamed it
[00:57.10]Bending it to their will
[01:00.65]And when the earth was ready, they looked to the sky
[01:06.20]And there, gave us their greatest gifts
[01:21.20]The sun to light the day, and the moon to keep watch in the night
[01:31.90]A celestial dance to order our moments
[01:35.85]The slow heartbeat of our world
[01:42.15]Two forces in perfect balance
[01:45.90]This is our foundation; from this, all else follows
[02:07.10]Dawn breaks through the darkened skies
[02:10.15]We lift our heads and dry our eyes
[02:13.25]When day is done, we're doubly blessed
[02:16.55]With starry sky and moon for rest
[02:19.75]No longer bound to hopelessness
[02:23.10]We dance as one with nature now
[02:26.50]The sun and moon will show us how
[02:49.55]Restless was the world we knew
[02:52.65]And cheerless were~ the days
[02:55.85]Of colors run together
[02:59.00]In an endless mirror maze
[03:02.40]But then two sisters brought us
[03:05.15]Out of Discord's dark caprice
[03:08.95]And gave us lights to guide us
[03:11.75]Into harmony and peace
[03:27.10]Day for rising; night for sleep
[03:33.65]As in heaven, so below
[03:40.20]Chaos banish; order keep
[03:46.70]Ever may it thusly go
[03:59.75]Memories are fading now
[04:02.85]The fog begins to thin
[04:06.05]The dreamer is awakened
[04:09.55]Life can begin
[04:12.60]And all that's past is preface
[04:15.30]To the story of today
[04:18.90]Now that harmony has come
[04:21.45]And driven dissonance away
[04:37.30]Day for rising; night for sleep
[04:43.85]As in heaven, so below
[04:50.35]Chaos banish; order keep
[04:56.90]Ever may it thusly go
[05:03.50]Perfect cosmic symmetry
[05:10.00]Sisters of the moon and sun
[05:16.50]Cornerstone of harmony
[05:23.00]Never let it be undone
[05:45.90]Day for rising
[05:52.40]Night for sleep
[05:58.95]Chaos banish
[06:05.45]Order keep~
