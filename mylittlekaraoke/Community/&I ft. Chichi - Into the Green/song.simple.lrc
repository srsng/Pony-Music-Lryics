[00:09.53]Flying through the air, I find it's hard to breath
[00:14.33]Sky so large and wide, it feels so wrong to me
[00:19.13]But I'm still happy 'cause there's a land below
[00:23.78]A place where bunnies hide and all the flowers grow
[00:28.73]Come and see
[00:32.03]This gentle living fantasy
[00:38.33]Come along you'll know what I mean
[00:40.73]Follow me into a land of green
[00:47.33]Oh oh oh
[01:07.13]Butterflies that soar through the air
[01:09.53]It's a place where you'll find no dispair
[01:14.33]Fall into the green
[01:16.73]See the earth that's flowing with life
[01:19.13]Free yourself from never-ending strife
[01:23.93]Fall into the green
[01:26.63]Feel Nature flowing right through me
[01:29.03]The Earth is turning 'round with me
[01:31.43]There's happiness on the ground that no one knows
[01:36.23]So come along, flutter with me
[01:38.63]Down to this calm eternity
[01:41.03]Just go fall into the green and see this
[01:44.33] World that's everfree
[03:31.13]Butterflies that soar through the air
[03:33.53]It's a place where you'll find no despair
[03:38.33]Fall into the green
[03:40.73]See the Earth that's flowing with life
[03:43.13]Free yourself from never-ending strife
[03:47.93]Fall into the green
[03:50.33]Flowing all around me
[03:52.73]I found my harmony
[03:55.13]Free from skies above me
[03:57.53]No one here to judge me
[03:59.93]Animals surround me
[04:02.33]Plants and trees a plenty
[04:04.73]Free from eyes that judge me
[04:07.13]In my home that's ever free
[04:13.13](Home that's ever free)
