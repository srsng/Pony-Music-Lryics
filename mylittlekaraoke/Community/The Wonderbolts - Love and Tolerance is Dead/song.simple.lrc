[00:29.49]Once Upon A Time
[00:30.40]In the magical land of the real world
[00:32.98]A pretty big fandom blew up
[00:34.26]On a show ostensibly made for little girls
[00:36.46]And being who we are we came up with certain memes
[00:38.65]And things to differentiate ourselves
[00:41.92]But you know
[00:43.32]As I've looked back
[00:44.28]Over these past few handful of years
[00:46.74]This phrase folks spouted to me
[00:48.46]Never really seemed sincere
[00:50.12]I mean sure it's a nice idea
[00:51.62]But once you add in the fact we're all human beings
[00:54.08]Well you know how that goes
[00:55.85]So I say
[00:57.19]Love and tolerance is dead~~
[01:00.40]I wanna find something else instead~
[01:03.83]Something that's a little bit more real
[01:05.98]For me and you~~~
[01:09.83]No this is not a social revolution
[01:12.89]Of which a single model offers a lasting solution
[01:16.74]No, some things you shouldn't tolerate
[01:19.26]Some people cannot be loved~~~~~~~~
[01:24.35]Now don't misunderstand me
[01:25.69]I'm not saying we should all quit and jump ship
[01:27.73]To whatever flavor of the month _____ fandom currently hip
[01:31.32]Oh no I still love these little horses
[01:33.35]And that right there'll never change
[01:35.76]Oh no~
[01:38.12]Oh see I just think those three little words
[01:40.05]Really have dropped the ball
[01:41.55]Because as the show has taught us
[01:43.15]One size does not fit all
[01:44.98]As for what we should use instead
[01:46.69]Well you're gonna have to ask
[01:47.55]Someone smarter than me filly
[01:49.85]'Cause all I know is
[01:52.10]Love and tolerance is dead~~~
[01:55.26]I wanna find something else instead~
[01:58.69]Something that's a little bit more real
[02:00.83]For me and you~~~
[02:04.64]Now this is not a call to disavow~
[02:07.74]This is a hoofsmack meant to drag us into now~~
[02:11.55]Realize, the legacy of before
[02:14.39]Doesn't have to remain~~~
[02:18.40]Oh yeah the past is gone now
[02:21.40]We gotta move on now, we gotta move on~
[02:25.26]The time is ours to take up the reins
[02:27.89]And rewrite all the rules~~~~~~
[02:32.12]Yeah I know that change can be sca~ry
[02:35.12]But we should be wa~ry of trotting in place~
[02:38.98]And that's why I say
[02:40.90]Love and Tolerance is dead~
[04:03.62]Yeah
[04:05.55]I know that change can be sca~ry
[04:07.74]But we should be wa~ry of trotting in place
[04:11.55]And that's why I say
[04:13.48]Love and Tolerance is dead
