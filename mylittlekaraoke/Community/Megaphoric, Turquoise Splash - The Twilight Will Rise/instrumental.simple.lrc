[00:21.79]I don't know how I can~ find
[00:25.66]The strength for~ what I've been as~signed
[00:29.92]My confidence has faded a~way~
[00:33.93]Like dusk chased by~ the ending~ day
[00:38.19]I'm caught between the day and the~ night
[00:42.12]Overshadowed by their blinding~ light
[00:46.45]The sun and moon; a dazzling~ pair~
[00:50.77]How could one like me ever hope to com~pare?
[00:54.49]But a voice within me says:
[00:57.91]“I will be~ brave
[01:00.04]I will be~ strong
[01:01.91]Despite those around~ who may tell me I'm wrong
[01:06.23]I'll make mis~takes
[01:08.11]I'll take them in~ stride
[01:10.30]For I am here and I've nothing to hide~
[01:14.30]The twilight will rise
[01:18.40]The twilight will~ rise~~~~”
[01:44.38]I've done so much to get this~ far
[01:48.26]Crossed every bridge, chased every~ star
[01:52.58]I've brought together dark and~ light~
[01:56.91]I've witnessed love and~ all its~ might
[02:00.85]Still some believe I do not~ have
[02:05.01]The strength it~ takes to rise and~ stand
[02:09.17]Above the rest and take my~ place~
[02:13.47]To protect and serve those~ of my~ race
[02:17.27]But a voice within me says:
[02:20.66]“I will be~ brave
[02:22.79]I will be~ strong
[02:24.67]Despite those around~ who may tell me I'm wrong
[02:28.99]I'll make mis~takes
[02:30.86]I'll take them in~ stride
[02:33.06]For I am here and I've nothing to hide~
[02:37.06]The twilight will rise
[02:41.19]The twilight will~ rise~~~~”
[03:18.60]I will be~ brave
[03:20.70]I will be~ strong
[03:22.63]And when they detest I will cry out in song
[03:26.89]I'll make mis~takes
[03:28.80]I'll take them in~ stride
[03:31.02]All of these doubts, I will cast them aside~
[03:35.16]I will not~ bend
[03:37.22]I will not~ break
[03:39.35]I must be strong now, for my kingdom's sake
[03:43.29]With help from my~ friends
[03:45.61]Evil will~ hide
[03:47.68]And I will stretch~ out my wings, touch the sky~
[03:51.55]The twilight will rise
[03:55.65]The twilight will~ rise~~~~!
