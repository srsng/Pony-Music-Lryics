[00:01.88]There once was a pony who travelled the land
[00:06.39]With a smile~ as bright as the sun
[00:10.81]She went town to town as a one pony band
[00:15.36]Sharing smiles with ev'ryone
[00:20.01]She always sang loudly so all could hear
[00:24.56]Her words that she sang~ with glee
[00:29.07]And all the townponies they all~ did cheer
[00:33.39]For this mare as pink as candy, oh…
[00:38.04]This pink pony bard~, this bright young mare
[00:42.41]Whose smiles~ and songs
[00:44.61]turned towns upside down
[00:47.06]Oh pink pony bard with your songs of joy
[00:51.42]May there never be a day that you frown
[00:55.88]This small pony sang
[00:57.71]to her own heart's content
[01:00.34]From the morning to the dark~ of night
[01:04.95]She made ev'ryday feel like one big event
[01:09.41]And she always was cheerful and bright
[01:14.01]The townponies claim
[01:15.75]that her songs were like spells
[01:18.37]For that no bard has done that before
[01:22.98]Her music just made all their emotions swell
[01:27.34]She was one pony none could ignore, oh…
[01:32.23]Pink pony bard~, one with such flare
[01:36.36]Whose grand sing-alongs
[01:38.57]went through all of town
[01:41.01]Oh pink pony bard with your songs of joy
[01:45.37]May there never be a day that you frown
[01:49.84]When the pink pony left
[01:51.71]there were tears to be shed
[01:54.34]For there was no one bard~ like she
[01:59.04]Her songs were so loved
[02:00.63]and they all soon were spread
[02:03.26]Across the land and through the sea
[02:08.01]Her name though unknown by most ponykind
[02:12.56]Her songs are still sung to this day
[02:16.65]But if you look and you listen I'm
[02:19.51]sure that you'll find
[02:21.34]That pony still sings~ and plays, Oh…
[02:26.23]Pink pony bard~, you bright young mare
[02:30.40]Your smiles~ and songs
[02:32.61]Turn towns upside down
[02:35.05]Oh pink pony bard with your songs of joy
[02:39.42]May there never be a day that you frown
[02:43.65]May there never be a day that you frown
