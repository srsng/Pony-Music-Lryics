[00:31.50]I wanna be a mobile supercompu~ter
[00:35.67]A vision of the future
[00:38.74]Begin the cyber revolution
[00:41.82]Mechanical fusion
[00:43.87]The perfect evolution
[00:48.74]With syste~matic ha~rmony
[00:52.33]I will run o~nto ete~rnity
[00:56.95]And although this metal's pa~rt of me
[01:00.54]I shall not lo~se my sanity
[01:13.87]Shatter the flesh and reinforce the bo~ne
[01:17.65]Embrace this carbon mesh this power's all my o~wn

[02:14.90]Resonating sound surro~unds me
[02:19.26]A power best described as godly
[02:22.33]At life's intersection
