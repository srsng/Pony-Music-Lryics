[00:25.99]Well my girl ain't nothing but a butterfly
[00:29.09]With soft and delicate wings~
[00:32.02]And every now and then she will flutter by
[00:34.57]And turn the jokers into kings~
[00:37.86]My world ain't nothing, is she gonna cry?
[00:40.78]Don't act like it's for separate things
[00:44.61]Maybe you should wake up to the truth
[00:47.90]And not just the beauty she brings
[00:51.00]She floats through the air like a lullaby
[00:53.74]Like a cradle in full swing~
[00:56.85]The weather shines through and i'ts cold inside
[00:59.40]And she turns winter into spring
[01:02.55]So for deep and loving for all the while
[01:05.89]Never let me have its sting
[01:09.54]Maybe you should wake up to the truth
[01:16.48]Not just the beauty that she~ brings
[01:21.45]Well maybe all I really need is just a little bit more time
[01:27.29]To find my way back home, to the one I love, my Fluttershy
[01:33.36] maybe all I really need is just a little bit more time
[01:39.02]To find my way back home, to the one I love
[01:43.59]To the one I love, my Fluttershy~~
[01:54.18]Ah~~
[02:02.81]Protecting how she feels behind her smile
[02:05.73]She knows I do just the same~
[02:08.65]Together we pretend~ that it's worth our while
[02:11.57]And in the end we share the blame~
[02:14.49]She thinks I don't feel and I'm full of guile
[02:17.41]Wants to make me bear the shame
[02:21.25]I would go so far as put my love on trial
[02:28.19]If she would kiss me once again
[02:34.03]If she would kiss~ me again
[02:38.96]Well maybe all I really need is just a little bit more time~
[02:44.85]To find my way back home, to the one I love, my Fluttershy
[02:50.92] maybe all I really need is just a little bit more time~
[02:56.58]To find my way back home, to the one I love
[03:01.19]To the one I love, my Fluttershy~~
[03:11.78]Take my hand, I'll take you anywhere
[03:22.37]So trust in me, I've got so much to share with you
[03:31.18]I've got so much to share~ with you~
[04:43.57] maybe all I really need is just a little bit more time~
[04:49.24]To find my way back home, to the one I love, my Fluttershy
[04:55.21] maybe all I really need is just a little bit more time~
[05:00.88]To find my way back home, to the one I love
[05:05.49]To the one I love, my Fluttershy~~
