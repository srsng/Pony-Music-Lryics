[00:26.04]Well my girl ain't nothing but a butterfly
[00:29.14]With soft and delicate wings~
[00:32.06]And every now and then she will flutter by
[00:34.62]And turn the jokers into kings~
[00:37.90]My world ain't nothing, is she gonna cry?
[00:40.83]Don't act like it's for separate things
[00:44.66]Maybe you should wake up to the truth
[00:47.95]And not just the beauty she brings
[00:51.05]She floats through the air like a lullaby
[00:53.79]Like a cradle in full swing~
[00:56.89]The weather shines through and i'ts cold inside
[00:59.45]And she turns winter into spring
[01:02.60]So for deep and loving for all the while
[01:05.89]Never let me have its sting
[01:09.54]Maybe you should wake up to the truth
[01:16.48]Not just the beauty that she~ brings
[01:21.45]Well maybe all I really need is just a little bit more time
[01:27.29]To find my way back home, to the one I love, my Fluttershy
[01:33.37] maybe all I really need is just a little bit more time
[01:39.03]To find my way back home, to the one I love
[01:43.59]To the one I love,
[01:48.34]Ah~~
[01:54.18]Ah~~
[02:02.81]Protecting how she feels behind her smile
[02:05.73]She knows I do just the same~
[02:08.65]Together we pretend~ that it's worth our while
[02:11.62]And in the end we share the blame~
[02:14.54]She thinks I don't feel and I'm full of guile
[02:17.46]Wants to make me bear the shame
[02:21.29]I would go so far as put my love on trial
[02:28.23]If she would kiss me once again
[02:34.08]If she would kiss~ me again
[02:39.05]Well maybe all I really need is just a little bit more time~
[02:44.89]To find my way back home, to the one I love, my Fluttershy
[02:50.96] maybe all I really need is just a little bit more time~
[02:56.62]To find my way back home
