[00:04.04]Okay, the world presents some problems
[00:06.63]And we don't know what to do
[00:08.80]You've come to find your feelings
[00:10.60]Aren't exactly what you knew
[00:12.83]The odds are stacked quite poorly
[00:14.58]If without a winning hand
[00:16.87]But bear in mind your faring's only worse if you don't
[00:20.12]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[00:22.29]Because they'll turn your chips to trash
[00:24.64]You've got to set your sights and hopes
[00:26.63]On setting not to crash
[00:28.55]The truth can seem quite bleak
[00:29.94]If you don't make your plans unfurl
[00:32.35]But I would not let that mar my opinion of-
[00:35.48]Fact is that if you could fix
[00:37.17]The failings of the current paradigm
[00:39.70]We would have a hero who's both been
[00:41.99]Elusive and on time
[00:44.58]Just one time
[00:46.75]And then
[00:48.67]We would all contrive new conflict
[00:50.90]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[00:53.07]Because they'll turn your chips to trash
[00:55.36]You've got to set your sights and hopes
[00:57.41]On setting not to crash
[00:59.28]The truth can seem quite bleak
[01:00.66]If you don't make your plans unfurl
[01:03.01]But I would not let that mar my opinion of your world
[01:21.45]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[01:23.73]Because they'll turn your chips to trash
[01:26.08]You've got to set your sights and hopes
[01:28.07]On setting not to crash
[01:29.88]The truth can seem quite bleak
[01:31.39]If you don't make your plans unfurl
[01:33.73]But I would not let that mar my opinion of the-
[01:36.81]Stipulations placed before you
[01:38.80]To get all the things you really need
[01:41.20]Mister Big may make things hard
[01:42.89]But you have got to plant your seeds
[01:45.90]Go to war
[01:48.13]Fight more
[01:50.12]Your dreams thrive by competition
[01:52.29]You'll find no one famous ever got there
[01:54.70]Just by flinching at their foes
[01:56.57]Cling against the torment
[01:58.07]Claw with all your might at what you know
[02:01.26]Don't let go
[02:03.43]Just grow
[02:05.42]Don't wait or play to indecision
[02:07.59]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[02:09.82]Because you've got to be more grand
[02:12.17]You've got to think ahead
[02:13.67]And carry out the things you've planned
[02:16.02]The truth can be of use
[02:17.53]When you can see where falsehoods lay
[02:19.88]Don't quit on hopes or dreams
[02:21.33]When you have simply got to
[02:23.01]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[02:25.24]Because they'll only drag you down
[02:27.53]You've got to keep on sailing
[02:29.28]Even when you want to frown
[02:31.33]The world will keep on turning
[02:33.07]Without matter where you land
[02:35.18]You might as well be running
[02:36.93]When your feet should hit the sand
[02:53.67]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[02:55.96]Because you've got to be more grand
[02:58.31]You've got to think ahead
[02:59.76]And carry out the things you've planned
[03:02.05]The truth can be of use
[03:03.55]When you can see where falsehoods lay
[03:05.90]Don't quit on hopes or dreams
[03:07.41]When you have simply got to
[03:09.10]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[03:11.26]Because they'll only drag you down
[03:13.61]You've got the means to live
[03:15.06]And it needs merely to be found
