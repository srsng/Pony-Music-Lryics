[00:02.41]Okay, the world presents some problems
[00:04.88]And we don't know what to do
[00:06.99]You've come to find your feelings
[00:08.73]Aren't exactly what you knew
[00:10.84]The odds are stacked quite poorly
[00:12.53]If without a winning hand
[00:14.64]But bear in mind your faring's only worse if you don't
[00:17.89]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[00:20.06]Because they'll turn your chips to trash
[00:22.41]You've got to set your sights and hopes
[00:24.40]On setting not to crash
[00:26.32]The truth can seem quite bleak
[00:27.71]If you don't make your plans unfurl

[00:33.19]Fact is that if you could fix
[00:34.82]The failings of the current paradigm
[00:37.41]We would have a hero who's both been
[00:39.70]Elusive and on time
[00:42.29]Just one time
[00:44.46]And then
[00:46.38]We would all contrive new conflict
[00:48.61]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[00:50.78]Because they'll turn your chips to trash
[00:53.07]You've got to set your sights and hopes
[00:55.12]On setting not to crash
[00:56.93]The truth can seem quite bleak
[00:58.43]If you don't make your plans unfurl
[01:00.78]But I would not let that mar my opinion of the--
[01:03.92]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[01:06.14]Because they'll turn your chips to trash
[01:08.43]You've got to set your sights and hopes
[01:10.42]On setting not to crash
[01:12.29]The truth can seem quite bleak
[01:13.79]If you don't make your plans unfurl
[01:16.14]But I would not let that mar my opinion of the-
[01:19.22]Stipulations placed before you
[01:21.20]To get all the things you really need
[01:23.55]Mister Big may make things hard
[01:25.30]But you have got to plant your seeds
[01:28.37]Go to war
[01:30.48]Fight more
[01:32.41]Your dreams thrive by competition
[01:34.58]You'll find no one famous ever got there
[01:36.99]Just by flinching at their foes
[01:38.92]Cling against the torment
[01:40.36]Claw with all your might at what you know
[01:43.79]Don't let go
[01:45.84]Just grow
[01:47.77]Don't wait or play to indecision
[01:49.94]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[01:52.17]Because you've got to be more grand
[01:54.52]You've got to think ahead
[01:56.02]And carry out the things you've planned
[01:58.37]The truth can be of use
[01:59.82]When you can see where falsehoods lay
[02:02.17]Don't quit on hopes or dreams
[02:03.67]When you have simply got to
[02:05.36]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[02:07.59]Because they'll only drag you down
[02:09.88]You've got to keep on sailing
[02:11.63]Even when you want to frown
[02:13.67]The world will keep on turning
[02:15.42]Without matter where you land
[02:17.53]You might as well be running
[02:19.28]When your feet should hit the sand
[02:35.96]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[02:38.25]Because you've got to be more grand
[02:40.60]You've got to think ahead
[02:42.11]And carry out the things you've planned
[02:44.40]The truth can be of use
[02:45.90]When you can see where falsehoods lay
[02:48.25]Don't quit on hopes or dreams
[02:49.76]When you have simply got to
[02:51.45]Chin up! Don't bet on sinking ships
[02:53.61]Because they'll only drag you down
[02:56.02]You've got the means to live
[02:57.47]And it needs merely to be found
