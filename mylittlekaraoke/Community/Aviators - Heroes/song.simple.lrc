[00:55.12]The battle ends tonight
[00:56.84]It's time to fight our fight
[00:58.56]Hoping somehow we'll have the courage to be the
[01:02.00]Light in the darkest hour
[01:03.72]When things are turning sour
[01:05.44]Blind hope is worthless if all we do is
[01:08.67]Wage our wa-ars and fight in vain
[01:12.11]Suffer all this worthless pain
[01:15.71]We've got to answer a cry for he-lp
[01:19.58]The world won't save itself
[01:22.37]We can be the heroes
[01:24.74]We can dare to sa-ve the da-y
[01:28.39]Standing up to those still in our way
[01:35.92]With courage we'll keep fighting for
[01:39.30]The search we're on for something more
[01:42.31]Pushing through until the wa-ar i-is won
[01:46.83]We can be the heroes we-'ve become
[02:03.65]Too late to be afraid
[02:05.37]Now we can't run away
[02:07.09]We've got to hold fast and embrace the strength we've
[02:10.53]Found in our time of doubt
[02:12.25]Somehow we'll make it out
[02:14.18]We'll find who we really are
[02:16.76]Tonight we're never backing do-wn
[02:20.85]It's far too late to turn back now
[02:24.50]Not afraid of the perilous
[02:27.94]Oh no, we were born for this
[02:30.95]We can be the heroes
[02:33.31]We can dare to sa-ve the da-y
[02:36.97]Standing up to those still in our way
[02:44.44]With courage we'll keep fighting for
[02:47.88]The search we're on for something more
[02:50.89]Pushing through until the wa-ar i-is won
[02:55.40]We can be the heroes we-'ve become
[03:12.66]Now we'll make it out
[03:14.59]We'll stick together and get
[03:17.17]Through this storm somehow
[03:19.53]It's too late to back down and r-u-u-u-u-un
[03:26.63]Hope is go-one, but harmony's strong
[03:30.01]We've had the power in us all alo-o-ong
[03:34.53]To embrace the heroes that we've beco-o-o-o-o-o-ome
[04:06.88]We can be the heroes
[04:09.25]We can dare to sa-ve the da-y
[04:12.85]Standing up to those still in our way
[04:20.43]With courage we'll keep fighting for
[04:23.81]The search we're on for something more
[04:26.82]Pushing through until the wa-ar i-is won
[04:31.28]We can be the heroes we-'ve become
[04:38.22]We can be the heroes we've become
[04:45.10]We can be the heroes we've become
