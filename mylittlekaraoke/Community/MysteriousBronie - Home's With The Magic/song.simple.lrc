[00:19.50]The rain's out tonight
[00:23.14]I know you're looking for
[00:25.50]A place to rest your head~~
[00:30.00]I know we said
[00:33.48]Things that~ were wrong
[00:36.37]In the heat of the moment we got
[00:39.43]Lost in our words~~
[00:42.91]Now you're all alone
[00:46.34]Wandering the streets
[00:48.91]Looking for a new home but
