[00:19.75]I've been away for so long everything I used to know has changed
[00:29.35]I don't recognize this place, I'm the only one who's still the same
[00:39.25]I try not to be bitter
[00:44.05]I try to be strong
[00:48.85]I try to make my voice heard
[00:53.35]But it always comes out wrong
[00:58.15]I scream but nopony hears me
[01:03.25]I'm drowned out by the noise
[01:07.75]I call but nopony answers
[01:12.55]With my Royal Canterlot Voice
[01:17.05]I hardly go outside but when I do the ponies talk behind my back
[01:27.25]The nighttime is so lonely that sometimes I feel about to crack
[01:36.85]I try not to be angry
[01:41.65]I try to belong
[01:46.45]I try to make myself heard
[01:50.95]But it always comes out wrong
[01:55.75]I scream but nopony hears me
[02:00.85]I'm drowned out by the noise
