[00:02.46]I'm the Princess of the Night
[00:04.46]So of course they run in fright
[00:06.52]They feel threatened and unsure
[00:08.45]So let's heighten your allure
[00:10.44]I don't think you understand
[00:12.50]I bring darkness to their land
[00:14.50]But what causes them to flee
[00:16.49]Must be my supremacy
[00:18.49]Make it so they can't resist
[00:20.42]So that we can coexist
[00:22.48]You'll be welcome in their clique
[00:24.42]TALKING LOUD SHOULD DO THE TRICK
[00:26.41]Turn your social life around
[00:28.47]Ditch those boots and homely crown
[00:30.47]I can help with one small fee
[00:32.40]Give your Princesshood to me!
