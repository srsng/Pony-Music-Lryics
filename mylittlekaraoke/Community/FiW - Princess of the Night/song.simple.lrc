[00:02.69]I'm the Princess of the Night
[00:04.68]So of course they run in fright
[00:06.74]They feel threatened and unsure
[00:08.67]So let's heighten your allure
[00:10.67]I don't think you understand
[00:12.73]I bring darkness to their land
[00:14.72]But what causes them to flee
[00:16.72]Must be my supremacy
[00:18.72]Make it so they can't resist
[00:20.65]So that we can coexist
[00:22.71]You'll be welcome in their clique
[00:24.64]TALKING LOUD SHOULD DO THE TRICK
[00:26.64]Turn your social life around
[00:28.70]Ditch those boots and homely crown
[00:30.69]I can help with one small fee
[00:32.62]Give your Princesshood to me!
