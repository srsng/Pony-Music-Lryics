I'm the Princess of the Night
So of course they run in fright
They feel threatened and unsure
So let's heighten your allure
I don't think you understand
I bring darkness to their land
But what causes them to flee
Must be my supremacy
Make it so they can't resist
So that we can coexist
You'll be welcome in their clique
TALKING LOUD SHOULD DO THE TRICK
Turn your social life around
Ditch those boots and homely crown
I can help with one small fee
Give your Princesshood to me!
