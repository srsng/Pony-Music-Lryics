[20:24.19]Deep here in the Hayseed Swamp
[20:26.29]We've lived a long 'ol time
[20:28.76]Doin' our best to get along
[20:30.86]With all the critter life
[20:32.92]Our masks and stews all simple but
[20:35.25]It's peaceful and sublime
[20:37.65]Never had too much hardship or
[20:39.97]Even a little strife
[20:41.66]'Til the folks fell sick
[20:43.76]With all these horrid spots
[20:46.24]Coughing up with bubbles
[20:48.56]Sneezing lightning snot
[20:52.39]Cough, pop, zap and boom
[20:54.38]The plague was spreading way too soon
[20:56.89]Cough, pop, zap and boom
[20:58.91]I feared it'd be our doom
[21:00.97]If I could not mix a healin' brew
[21:03.41]The fever'd claim me too
[21:05.74]With no one left to do
[21:07.39]We'd say adieu
[21:19.42]Every old elixir and
[21:21.38]Each potion I could find
[21:23.78]Didn't change that accursed plant
[21:25.91]Or poison that's inside
[21:28.12]When soon it claimed my mother too
[21:30.45]In bed she slept maligned
[21:32.66]I stared down in the bayou to
[21:35.10]See if that'd provide
[21:36.86]Me the answer to
[21:38.92]Save everyone I loved
[21:41.44]When some flash bees flew out
[21:43.72]Hovered just above
[21:46.50]â€‹Cough, pop, zap and boom
[21:48.49]The flowers opened up their plumes
[21:50.96]Cough, pop, zap and boom
[21:52.95]And spread their toxic fumes
[21:55.20]But the flash bees were left unamused
[21:57.45]And took the pollen too
[21:59.74]And that is when I knew
[22:01.39]What I must do
[23:13.84]After many tries
[23:15.83]And far too many stings
[23:18.38]I did realize
[23:20.44]Just what would be the thing
[23:22.84]For my healin' mask
[23:24.83]Looked like the flash bee queen
[23:27.34]Let me take their honey
[23:29.62]Without gettin' mean
[23:35.78]Cough, pop, zap and boom
[23:38.03]One by one and room to room
[23:40.31]Cough, pop, zap and boom
[23:42.30]The honey once consumed
[23:44.55]Healed them all up quick, shooed away the gloom
[23:46.80]We drank the healin' brew
[23:49.05]And all escaped the tomb
[23:50.81]But nowâ€¦ not much I can do
[23:53.55]Unless you need a potion brewed
[23:56.10]But I've done my due
[23:58.05]To see our problems through
[24:00.22]If you really think you need me too
[24:02.55]I'll pack some different brews
[24:04.80]And help you to undo
[24:06.67]The Sirens' gloom
