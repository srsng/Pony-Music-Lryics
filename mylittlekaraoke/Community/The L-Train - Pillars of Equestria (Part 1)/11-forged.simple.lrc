[37:04.16]So now you've heard each story we~ could tell
[37:11.06]And what has brought me to you as~ well
[37:18.11]My village left bewitched beneath~ their song
[37:24.75]With every passing day, it prolongs~~
[37:31.61]Everyone I know and love
[37:34.80]Cursed to be their slaves
[37:38.44]We could bring the Si~rens down
[37:41.85]We could save
[38:30.26]I sympathise what you've en~dured
[38:35.78]But you know not what you're saying
[38:39.00]And know not its al~lure
[38:42.90]All of my students come to~ learn
[38:48.45]That all sorcery is power
[38:51.56]Which demands that you dis~cern
[38:54.79]You collect them like torches to burn a fire~ bright
[39:01.09]But think not what to do when you too ignite
[39:06.64]When forged by life, what we can create
[39:10.01]Is all but a candle compared to the fates
[39:13.76]But you wish to take their power for your own
[39:19.28]When forged divine, a magic runs deep
[39:22.69]An ocean whose edges that we'll never see
[39:26.40]You know not the costs such sorcery
[39:29.59]Could rise from the unknown
[39:49.54]Respectfully, you must believe me
[39:54.82]That these gifts that they~ were granted
[39:58.05]Are branches of~ a tree
[40:02.10]I think of them more like the~ sun
[40:07.50]Not a group of little torches~
[40:10.65]But a light for every~one
[40:13.76]Or as beams in a rainbow of every colored light
[40:20.10]Who could end e~very storm and be glowing bright
[40:25.54]They're forged as one, whatever you say
[40:28.95]All elements of something come from the fates
[40:32.74]You can see it for yourself or turn away
[40:38.25]For all you've done, the spells you have penned
[40:41.59]The things that will shape ponykind to its end
[40:45.38]Yet you disavow this chance we have
[40:48.53]'Cause of what we might pay?
[41:05.06]I know I should have died that day
[41:08.25]By dragon fire or lightning yet
[41:11.44]We found that we could do much more
[41:14.51]When greater challenges are set
[41:17.85]I thought I'd failed my home and kin
[41:20.81]But from the state that things were in
[41:24.04]We turned the darkness back and
[41:26.78]Found the answer hiding deep within
[41:30.41]While fear once al~most held me back
[41:33.49]I couldn't sit around and mope
[41:36.68]I had to take the leap and
[41:39.45]Put my trust in hope
[41:55.57]Alright, I've heard you make your~ case
[42:01.09]It is clear to me these wonders
[42:04.24]Must have a higher~ place
[42:08.25]And since you'll do it either~ way
[42:13.69]With a sorcerer~ to guide you
[42:16.88]You might not go as~tray
[42:20.06]There indeed is much darkness
[42:23.21]That we could cast away
[42:26.32]To a place they'd be left
[42:28.91]To decay~~~~
[42:35.06]So forged as one, with firmament laid
[42:38.47]We'll rise up as Pillars protecting the gates
[42:42.15]For all who may need us on that day
[42:47.66]And forged as one, we'll keep building high
[42:51.04]These gifts for all creatures to come for all time
[42:54.71]And bring Harmony to all
[42:57.30]Who have been left in dismay~~
