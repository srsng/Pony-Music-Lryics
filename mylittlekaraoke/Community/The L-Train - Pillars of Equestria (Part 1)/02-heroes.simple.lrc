[04:00.53]How could you run off frigh~tened
[04:03.94]When they all needed you?
[04:06.71]To leave them 'neath the spell, abandon all you once knew
[04:11.59]And after all that's hap~pened
[04:15.00]Just you alone are free
[04:17.74]But what more can I do, then turn my tail and flee
[04:22.61]I've lived a simple life
[04:25.39]I'm no one great or migh~ty
[04:33.64]What more could I have done
[04:36.41]Who would the hero rightly be?
[04:39.82]The hero I seek
[04:43.95]Protect the humble and weak
[04:52.99]If only I could find~ one
[04:56.40]A warrior or mage
[04:59.18]Or even search for him, the greatest wizard of this age
[05:04.69]But who would wish to come
[05:07.43]To save our lowly town
[05:10.20]When monsters hide in every shadow that is found
[05:15.04]But how would they all hide
[05:17.74]If light could shine for all to see?
[05:26.06]Why find a single knight
[05:28.84]When we could have an army be
[05:32.25]The heroes I seek
[05:36.34]To fight what evil may wreak
[06:25.01]If they'd only hear my plea
[06:29.93]Far be~yond the Sirens
[06:33.34]Just imagine what could be
[06:48.52]We would stand the vanguard against anything
[06:54.00]Every battle could be won
[06:56.85]When they'd need~ us we would be
[07:00.41]United, as guardians to save everyone
[07:05.10]History is full of evils left astray
[07:10.57]Like a plague upon the world
[07:13.39]Darkness we could finally seal away
[07:23.32]We could forge something great
[07:26.10]Protect all those who are in need
[07:34.31]Each foe would know their fate
[07:37.09]As righteous Pillars they could be
[07:40.54]The heroes I seek
[07:44.70]To stand when all else looks bleak
[07:50.18]To save the vanquished and meek
[07:57.11]The heroes I seek
