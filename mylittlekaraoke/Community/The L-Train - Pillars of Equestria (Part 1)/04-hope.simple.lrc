[09:43.09]She came, demanding tribute
[09:48.23]Our harvest hers to consume
[09:52.76]As our hunger continued
[09:57.75]It seemed she'd be our doom
[10:02.33]There was no one to stop her
[10:07.42]This Sphinx a beast so daunting
[10:11.85]Yet still our Prince would be stirred
[10:17.36]To resist her taunting
[10:21.49]The beast was displeased
[10:24.83]Snatched him away to her temple lair
[10:31.12]For him to be freed
[10:34.42]Her riddle must be solved if we dare
[10:40.76]All we know
[10:43.09]All we owe
[10:45.52]All that shines as the Glowpaz glows
[10:50.33]All from faith
[10:52.73]All from Hope~
[11:04.76]I knew it was my doing
[11:09.67]From such an innocent alm
[11:14.33]Quickly I galloped after
[11:19.39]I knew I must save Hi~san
[11:24.04]She asked me the phrase
[11:27.26]One simple riddle with all at stake
[11:33.52]Then, I would elate
[11:36.86]I knew the answer without mistake
[11:54.98]The sphinx scrunched up her wicked face
[11:57.19]To hear the answer found
[11:59.59]She roared and said "you'll know your place"
[12:01.99]Then stomped against the ground
[12:04.35]"But the riddles' solved!"
[12:05.66]"You're not absolved"
[12:06.83]She said with leering eyes
[12:09.23]"Your bounty still belongs to me"
[12:11.62]Her word, a hollow lie
[12:13.95]I could not leave the Prince in chains
[12:16.46]And let her steal from everyone
[12:18.79]"But what about another game?
[12:21.23]A challenge all or none"
[12:23.66]"But if I win you'll go away
[12:26.06]And leave our village be"
[12:28.42]The Sphinx intrigued said: "We shall see"
[12:30.83]Then laughed aloud in glee
[13:11.92]Blind and without wings
[13:15.26]She had me cross that most dangerous pool
[13:21.56]But I made the leap
[13:24.83]I held to Hope like a precious jewel
[13:31.12]All we know
[13:33.52]All we owe
[13:35.96]All that shines as the Glowpaz glows
[13:40.73]All from faith
[13:43.12]All from Hope
[13:45.56]I was blessed
[13:47.92]I still owe
[13:50.36]There's no way I could tell you "no"
[13:55.12]I will come
[13:57.49]Bring them Hope~!
