[26:13.16][P1] Being just a Legion grunt
[26:14.78][P1] I traveled wherever they needed me
[26:17.40][P1] And although the pegasi do rule the skies
[26:19.99][P1] The job ain't that easy
[26:21.56][P1] But it's not the griffons or the hippogriffs
[26:24.11][P1] That give us much to fear
[26:25.72][P1] When one of those giant stinking dragons
[26:28.05][P1] Gets a little bit too near~~~
[26:30.22][P2] Yeah forever we will fly
[26:32.51][P1] Every tempest you may see~
[26:34.39][P2] Flying free in every sky
[26:36.94][P1] None shall stay thee
[26:38.59][P2] They are ours to take and form
[26:40.88][P1] Knowing you are called to be
[26:42.75][P2] For the Legion is the storm~!
[26:47.29][P1] Brave enough!
[26:47.33][P2] Brave enough!
[26:49.84][P1] No matter what the problem
[26:51.45][P2] Forged so tough!
[26:51.53][P1] Forged so tough!
[26:54.41][P1] If it tries to kill you
[26:55.65][P2] Show your stuff!
[26:55.69][P1] Show your stuff!
[26:58.31][P1] 'Cause it's them who won't be
[26:59.85][P1] Brave enough!
[26:59.85][P2] Brave enough!
[27:12.71][P1] Then on such a mission
[27:13.91][P1] We did have to get
[27:15.26][P1] Across the dragon lands
[27:16.88][P1] When we saw two of them large enough
[27:18.83][P1] To wrap us in a single hand
[27:21.08][P1] Many of our comrades were ensnared
[27:23.14][P1] And taken back into their cave
[27:25.20][P1] I could not just leave them like that
[27:26.92][P1] There must be a way that we can save~!
[27:29.70][P2] Yeah together we will fly
[27:31.88][P1] Like feathers in a wing
[27:33.86][P2] It takes all to soar so high
[27:36.41][P1] We'd be nothing
[27:38.06][P2] Lest we fall back down to earth
[27:40.35][P1] And as one be ascending~
[27:42.26][P2] Every one of us has worth~
[27:46.76][P1] Brave enough!
[27:46.80][P2] Brave enough!
[27:49.28][P1] Out from the cave I led them
[27:50.92][P1] Forged so tough!
[27:50.96][P2] Forged so tough!
[27:53.85][P1] As they tried to roast me
[27:55.12][P1] Show your stuff!
[27:55.12][P2] Show your stuff!!
[27:57.86][P1] With the shield I could be
[27:59.33][P1] Brave enough!
[27:59.33][P2] Brave enough!
[29:02.62][P2] And as heroes we will fly
[29:04.76][P1] As the storm was gathering
[29:06.75][P2] Through the darkest of the skies
[29:09.26][P1] Full of lightning
[29:10.91][P2] When the thunder swallows you
[29:13.24][P1] You'll not be cowering
[29:15.11][P2] All as one we'll see it through~
[29:21.71][P1] Brave enough!
[29:21.71][P2] Brave enough!
[29:24.19][P1] Somehow we really made it
[29:25.88][P1] Forged so tough!
[29:25.91][P2] Forged so tough!
[29:28.88][P1] Like the shield we all could
[29:30.04][P1] Show your stuff!
[29:30.11][P2] Show your stuff!
[29:32.81][P1] Play the role we all should
[29:34.24][P1] Brave enough!
[29:34.31][P2] Brave enough!
[29:38.47][P1] You've got guts
[29:40.95][P1] To pull this all together
[29:42.64][P1] You know what?
[29:45.49][P1] Yes I'm gonna join you
[29:46.80][P1] They'd be~ nuts
[29:49.46][P1] If they think they could beat
[29:51.00][P1] All of us!
