[15:28.31]As but a colt
[15:29.89]I would work in the fields
[15:31.84]Of our peaceful seaside realm
[15:35.85]Wishing one day
[15:37.31]I could be strong enough
[15:39.34]To join the~ Mighty Helm
[15:47.14]But I was small
[15:48.71]Not muscled or tall
[15:50.59]'Twas a thing I might never be
[15:54.64]Shovel in hoof
[15:56.14]I set out to prove
[15:58.16]That they would have a place for me
[16:01.20]With what strength I could find
[16:03.64]I worked hard as I might
[16:05.62]'Twas a dream I would never let go
[16:08.77]With all body and mind
[16:11.25]Through the day and the night
[16:13.16]I refused to relent
[16:15.00]'Til I made that dream so
[16:19.50]Our village laid place
[16:21.52]At a volcano base
[16:23.44]Never once had we seen it blow
[16:27.45]Then on that day
[16:28.95]We found we would face
[16:30.98]The~ wrath of its fiery glow
[16:34.01]We had no way to fight
[16:36.56]All the lava we saw
[16:38.40]And the Helm said we had to go
[16:41.55]But despite all our fright
[16:44.02]We just couldn't withdraw
[16:45.90]We could not leave our homes
[16:47.48]And the land that we know
[17:04.65]The river of lava got closer and closer
[17:08.70]Soon to consume everything that we were
[17:12.49]I could do little but had to do something
[17:16.09]So shovel in hoof I dug into the dirt
[17:19.95]Digging the trench all my efforts seemed foolish
[17:23.78]Weak as I was I would run out of time
[17:27.30]I needed a strength that would meet my ambition
[17:31.09]When there in a flash happened something divine
[18:25.24]With what I'd been blessed
[18:27.22]I carved out the trench
[18:29.06]And was able to save the town
[18:32.74]The lesson I learned
[18:34.65]Was still to endure
[18:36.53]When it seems all is com~ing down
[18:39.64]With Great Strength you can find
[18:42.15]That no matter the fight
[18:44.03]You can beat almost every foe
[18:47.17]With your brethren combined
[18:49.69]You'll be able to smite
[18:51.56]Every villain that you couldn't face (just alone)
[18:54.71]With the Helm at my side
[18:57.11]We protected our land
[18:58.99]And with them that will still be so
[19:02.21]For these Sirens may try
[19:04.61]But they're standing in sand
[19:06.60]We'll knock them aside
[19:08.14]Yes indeed I will go~~!
