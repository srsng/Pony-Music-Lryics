[01:07.32]So this~ is my ascent
[01:18.66]A corona~tion on~ly I'll at~tend
[01:29.96]The night~ of which I dreamed~
[01:41.21]With no one to~ admire it but me~
[01:52.94]In the dark~ness I've embraced
[01:58.59]I still see your twisted~ face
[02:04.19]"To~ the moon" - my sister's iro~ny~
[03:00.31]If this~ is how it ends
[03:11.91]Nightmare in~side me my only~ friend
[03:22.94]How different will it be~
[03:34.23]From reigning o~ver quietude and~ sleep~
[03:45.84]Safe in dreams~ so bright and~ clear
[03:51.18]My subjects can~ ignore their~ fears
[03:56.78]But also all~ of my night's majesty~
[04:09.18]My story does not~ end in this fall
[04:14.60](My story never ends)
[04:20.38]Despite~ this exo~dus
[04:25.32]I'll~ return~ to rule you~ all
[04:31.68]So spend this night in sweet pursuit
[04:42.04]And hope the queen~ of nightmares smiles~
[04:47.56]Upon~ your tribute
[05:15.88]So dream~ of me tonight
[05:27.44]Show me your~ devotion in your fright
[05:38.78]Know a world~ forever without sun
[05:50.03]Drowning in this terror I've become
[06:00.97]My sister hides~ a tyrant's lies
[06:06.66]In brightest day~ and sunlit skies
[06:12.31]But in the world~ I rule, there is no light
[06:24.75]My story does not~ end in this fall
[06:30.09](My story never ends)
[06:35.91]Despite~ this exo~dus
[06:40.85]I'll~ return~ to rule you~ all
[06:47.16]So spend this night in sweet pursuit
[06:57.57]And hope the queen~ of nightmares smiles~
[07:03.13]Upon~ your tri~bute
