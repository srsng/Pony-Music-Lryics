Don't look for me in the spotlight
Don't think that I am the one
Who brightens your lives
And endlessly strives
To live a life in the sun
I will never shine, I'll never be beautiful,
And I will never be yours
She made it clear, I should stay right here,
So you can be sure
That I am no hero
I can't answer your prayers
No matter how I feel inside
I know that nobody cares
For I am no hero
And when you look to the sky
You will never see my face
You'll never see me cry
This is the real me,
Unashamed, but not unafraid
I won't say I'm sorry
For who I was,
I can't say I've never strayed
Far from the light, away from the path
That all the righteous have tread
But I'll never lie, no I'll never try
To claim I'm perfect instead
For I am no hero
I can't answer your prayers
No matter how it feels inside
I know that nobody cares
For I am no hero
And when you look to the sky
You will never see my face
You'll never see me cry
No I am not perfect,
I just wanna be
The one you look up to
In times of need,
But you love another,
I'll never be the same
When you're lonely like me,
Don't call for my name
Don't call my name
name
