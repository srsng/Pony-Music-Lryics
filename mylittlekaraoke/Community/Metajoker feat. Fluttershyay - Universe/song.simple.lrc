[00:29.07]Is it worth a shot
[00:31.55]Should I really change my life forever
[00:35.94]And lose the world that I kno-ow?
[00:42.99]Is it true or not
[00:45.61]Can we really se-e it a-all together
[00:50.22]Oh, I'm not ready to go-o
[00:57.31]Some called it lu-u-uck
[01:00.01]But is it re-ally better knowing
[01:04.47]I'd almost rather have never met you
[01:11.53]I'm lightning-stru-u-uck
[01:14.49]Inside I know that I'll be going
[01:18.61]I know I never could just forget you
[01:39.80]You're taking me to another place
[01:42.46]And I never even said my goodbyes
[01:46.89]My world expands to a universe
[01:49.59]And the light of stars reflects in my eyes
[01:54.01]You're taking me to a different time
[01:56.71]Where my doubts and fears are not to be found
[02:00.42]My world expands and I fe-el alive
[02:03.84]As my body and my soul leave the ground
[02:07.10]Oh uh woah
[02:22.47]A bolt in the blu-u-e
[02:25.32]An infinite displa-ay of splendour
[02:29.60]Like a door to worlds in my he-e-ad
[02:36.80]Then there was yo-o-u
[02:39.76]The guardian who bade me "Enter"
[02:44.67]The only word that you sa-id
[02:50.82]You're not as you se-em
[02:53.52]And now I'm holding on for o-ur ascension
[02:57.99]It's almost like I've do-one this befo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ore
[03:05.30]In all my dre-ams
[03:07.81]I never had the sli-ightest glimpse of heaven
[03:12.16]But in your eyes I see that, and mo-ore
[03:19.29]You're taking me to another place
[03:21.99]And I never even said my goodbyes
[03:26.41]My world expands to a universe
[03:29.15]And the light of stars reflects in my eyes
[03:33.46]You're taking me to a different time
[03:36.20]Where my doubts and fears are not to be found
[03:39.95]My wo-orld expands and I fe-el alive
[03:43.32]As my body and my soul leave the ground
[03:46.62]Oh uh woah oh
[04:01.66]Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da
[04:05.75]Da Da Da Da
[04:08.86]Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da
[04:12.84]Da Da-a-a Da Da
[04:16.14]You're taking me across ti-ime and space
[04:18.88]To realities my mind couldn't see
[04:23.30]My wo-orld expands to a universe
[04:26.00]Though I'll never know what you see in me
[04:30.46]You're taking me to another place
[04:33.12]And I never even said my goodbyes
[04:37.51]My wo-orld expands to a universe
[04:40.40]And the light of stars reflects in my-y eyes
[04:44.64]You're taking me to a different time
[04:47.34]Where my doubts and fears are not to be found
[04:51.09]My wo-orld expands and I fe-el alive
[04:54.46]As my body and my soul leave the ground
[04:57.76]Oh uh woah
