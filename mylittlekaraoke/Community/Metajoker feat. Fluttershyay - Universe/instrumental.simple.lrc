[00:29.14]Is it worth a shot
[00:31.65]Should I really change my life forever
[00:36.00]And lose the world that I kno-ow?
[00:43.05]Is it true or not
[00:45.67]Can we really se-e it a-all together
[00:50.28]Oh, I'm not ready to go-o
[00:57.41]Some call it lu-u-uck
[01:00.07]But is it re-ally better knowing
[01:04.53]I'd almost rather have never met you
[01:11.59]I'm lightning-stru-u-uck
[01:14.55]Inside I know that I'll be going
[01:18.67]I know I never could just forget you
[01:39.86]You're taking me to another place
[01:42.60]And I never even said my goodbyes
[01:46.95]My world expands to a universe
[01:49.72]And the light of stars reflects in my eyes
[01:54.07]You're taking me to a different time
[01:56.77]Where my doubts and fears are not to be found
[02:00.48]My world expands and I fe-el alive
[02:03.94]As my body and my soul leave the ground
[02:07.16]Oh uh woah
[02:22.61]A bolt in the blu-u-e
[02:25.46]An infinite displa-ay of splendour
[02:29.73]Like a door to worlds in my he-e-ad
[02:36.94]Then there was yo-o-u
[02:39.90]The guardian who bade me "Enter"
[02:44.81]The only word that you sa-id
[02:50.96]You're not as you se-em
[02:53.66]And now I'm holding on for o-ur ascension
[02:58.12]It's almost like I've do-one this befo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ore
[03:05.44]In all my dre-ams
[03:07.95]I never had the sli-ightest glimpse of heaven
[03:12.30]But in your eyes I see that, and mo-ore
[03:19.42]You're taking me to another place
[03:22.12]And I never even said my goodbyes
[03:26.55]My world expands to a universe
[03:29.28]And the light of stars reflects in my eyes
[03:33.60]You're taking me to a different time
[03:36.33]Where my doubts and fears are not to be found
[03:40.08]My wo-orld expands and I fe-el alive
[03:43.46]As my body and my soul leave the ground
[03:46.76]Oh uh woah oh
[04:01.80]Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da
[04:05.88]Da Da Da Da
[04:09.00]Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da
[04:12.97]Da Da-a-a Da Da
[04:16.27]You're taking me across ti-ime and space
[04:19.01]To realities my mind couldn't see
[04:23.44]My wo-orld expands to a universe
[04:26.13]Though I'll never know what you see in me
[04:30.60]You're taking me to another place
[04:33.26]And I never even said my goodbyes
[04:37.65]My wo-orld expands to a universe
[04:40.54]And the light of stars reflects in my-y eyes
[04:44.77]You're taking me to a different time
[04:47.47]Where my doubts and fears are not to be found
[04:51.22]My wo-orld expands and I fe-el alive
[04:54.60]As my body and my soul leave the ground
[04:57.90]Oh uh woah
