Is it worth a shot
Should I really change my life forever
And lose the world that I kno-ow?
Is it true or not
Can we really se-e it a-all together
Oh, I'm not ready to go-o
Some called it lu-u-uck
But is it re-ally better knowing
I'd almost rather have never met you
I'm lightning-stru-u-uck
Inside I know that I'll be going
I know I never could just forget you
You're taking me to another place
And I never even said my goodbyes
My world expands to a universe
And the light of stars reflects in my eyes
You're taking me to a different time
Where my doubts and fears are not to be found
My world expands and I fe-el alive
As my body and my soul leave the ground
Oh uh woah
A bolt in the blu-u-e
An infinite displa-ay of splendour
Like a door to worlds in my he-e-ad
Then there was yo-o-u
The guardian who bade me "Enter"
The only word that you sa-id
You're not as you se-em
And now I'm holding on for o-ur ascension
It's almost like I've do-one this befo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ore
In all my dre-ams
I never had the sli-ightest glimpse of heaven
But in your eyes I see that, and mo-ore
You're taking me to another place
And I never even said my goodbyes
My world expands to a universe
And the light of stars reflects in my eyes
You're taking me to a different time
Where my doubts and fears are not to be found
My wo-orld expands and I fe-el alive
As my body and my soul leave the ground
Oh uh woah oh
Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Da Da Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Da-a-a Da Da
You're taking me across ti-ime and space
To realities my mind couldn't see
My wo-orld expands to a universe
Though I'll never know what you see in me
You're taking me to another place
And I never even said my goodbyes
My wo-orld expands to a universe
And the light of stars reflects in my-y eyes
You're taking me to a different time
Where my doubts and fears are not to be found
My wo-orld expands and I fe-el alive
As my body and my soul leave the ground
Oh uh woah
