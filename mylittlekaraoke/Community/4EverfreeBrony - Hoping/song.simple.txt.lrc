I saved a row even though
I know it won't be taken
I thought at first you'd never go
I was so mistaken
I was told
Life won't last forever
But I've gone beyond the marker
What's one to do
How's one to feel
Where's one to go when their heart won't open?
So far away, yet so nearby
Feels as if someone's still watching over me
So, here's to hoping
Nowadays, I pick and choose
My circumstances
I don't belieieve that fate is up
For giving second chances
If I'm right
Time goes on forever
Feels like there's so much to remember
What's one to do
How's one to feel
Where's one to go when their heart won't open?
So far away, yet so nearby
Feels as if someone's still watching over me
So here's to
Holding on to a little faith
Keeping up with the present day
Standing well with the friends I made
Making sure that I don't lose my way
What's one to do
How's one to feel
Where's one to go when their heart won't open?
So far away, yet so nearby
Feels as if someone's still watching over me
So, here's to hoping
