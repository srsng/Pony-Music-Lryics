[00:14.34]I saved a ro-ow even though
[00:17.54]I know it wo-on't be taken
[00:20.61]I thought at fi-irst you'd never go
[00:23.90]I was so-o mi-istaken
[00:26.55]I was told
[00:29.29]Life won't last fore-ever
[00:33.20]But I've go-one beyond the ma-arker
[00:37.03]What's one to-o do
[00:40.11]How's one to-o fee-ee-eel
[00:43.18]Where's one to-o go-o when their heart won't open?
[00:49.41]So far away, yet so nearby-y-y
[00:55.64]Feels as if so-omeone's still watching over me
[01:01.62]So, here's to hoping
[01:16.48]Nowada-ays, I pick and choose
[01:19.97]My circumstances
[01:22.50]I don't belie-ieve that fate is up
[01:25.66]For giving se-eco-ond chances
[01:28.48]If I'm right
[01:31.22]Time goes on fore-ever
[01:34.96]Feels like there's so-o much to remember
[01:38.92]What's one to-o do
[01:42.08]How's one to-o feel
[01:45.11]Where's one to-o go-o when their heart won't open?
[01:51.38]So far away, yet so-o nearby-y
[01:57.57]Feels as if so-omeone's still watching over me
[02:03.51]So here's to
[02:05.32]Holding o-on to a little-e faith
[02:08.43]Keeping u-up with the present day
[02:11.63]Standing we-ell with the friends I-I made
[02:14.66]Making su-ure that I do-on't lose my-y way
[02:19.29]What's one to-o do
[02:22.33]How's one to-o feel
[02:25.48]Where's one to-o go-o when their heart won't open?
[02:31.63]So far away, yet so nearby-y-y
[02:37.82]Feels as if so-omeone's still watching over me
[02:43.80]So, here's to hoping
