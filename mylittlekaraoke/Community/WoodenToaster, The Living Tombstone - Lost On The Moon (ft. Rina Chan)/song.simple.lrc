[00:13.24]Saying goes that when you're stuck on a mountain
[00:15.96]You try to go up, you try to go down
[00:18.21]You turn around to face the wall
[00:20.05]so you can face yourself
[00:21.78]realizing you've made a mista-a-a-ake
[00:24.61]A-and you are being stuck on the moon
[00:26.71]Like the rest of us
[00:27.82]Trying to make sense of it
[00:29.29]Crying cause we don't have any reason
[00:31.57]We're all alone together
[00:33.12]'Cause we a-all share the very same cri-i-i-ime
[00:36.80]Some will say that this is not going to last long
[00:39.75]Some will say that if we try we can't go wrong
[00:42.58]As time goes on we are not leaving this place
[00:45.12]'Cause when we all come back
[00:46.48]We lose our track of time and space
[01:10.78]So together we are a-all lost on the moon
[01:14.13]We all share our ho-ome on the-e moon
[01:16.71]We forever we are lo-ost on the-e moon,
[01:19.73]Together we pay your crime o-on the moon
[01:23.85]Together we are lost on the-e moon
[01:26.72]We all share our home on the-e moon
[01:29.78]Fo-orever are lost on the mo-on
