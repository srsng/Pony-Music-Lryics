[00:19.86]Be yourself, they say, but be assertive
[00:24.73]Hold your ground but do not be unkind
[00:29.68]I have sought to be both lamb and lion
[00:34.55]Heartache is the thing I tend to find
[00:39.50]Can I only have what I can capture
[00:44.30]Will I be unheard~ unless I shout
[00:49.25]Clamor overwhelms~~ me and I wonder
[00:54.20]What is there to be so~ loud about?
[00:59.00]Many are the mu~sings of my shy~~~~~ heart
[01:03.81]Though precious few are spoken out aloud
[01:08.91]How I wish to wrap them up in confidence and style
[01:13.56]And send them out like magic through the crowd
[01:18.43]Then everyone would listen and I wouldn't be afraid~
[01:23.38]I wouldn't shrink away~~ and disappear~~~
[01:28.26]I don't want them to worship me or care that much at all
[01:33.20]I only want to know~ they know~~ I'm here
[01:40.70]I can wear a mask of pluck and power
[01:45.58]But it never says what I intend
[01:50.45]Words become like scissors in my keeping
[01:55.18]And friendships are so difficult to mend
[02:00.28]I don't want to shout above the babble
[02:05.23]I'm not even sure~ what I would say
[02:10.10]Maybe just, "Excuse me, could we maybe
[02:15.06]Be a little quieter today~?"
[02:19.85]Many are the mu~sings of my shy~~~~~ heart
[02:24.58]Though precious few are spoken out aloud
[02:29.68]How I wish to wrap them up in confidence and style
[02:34.41]And send them out like magic through the crowd
[02:39.20]Then everyone would listen and I wouldn't be afraid~
[02:44.23]I wouldn't shrink away~~ and disappear~~~
[02:49.03]I don't want them to worship me or care that much at all
[02:53.98]I only want to know~ they know~ I'm here
[02:58.85]I only want to know~ they know~~ I'm here
[03:59.00]Part of me has things she wants and wishes
[04:03.95]Part of me is worried she is wrong
[04:08.91]Part of me is busy masquerading
[04:13.33]As a girl whose pieces get along
[04:18.66]I don't mean to come across as distant
[04:23.53]I don't think it adds to my~ mystique
[04:28.41]I just find it difficult conversing
[04:33.06]And think an awful lot be~fore I speak
[04:38.23]Many are the mu~sings of my shy~~~~~ heart
[04:42.88]Though precious few are spoken out aloud
[04:48.06]How I wish to wrap them up in confidence and style
[04:52.78]And send them out like magic through the crowd
[04:57.58]Then everyone would listen and I wouldn't be afraid
[05:02.61]I wouldn't shrink away~~ and disappear~~~
[05:07.41]I don't want them to worship me or care that much at all
[05:12.36]I only want to know~ they know~~ I'm here
[05:17.23]I only want to know~ they know~ I'm here
