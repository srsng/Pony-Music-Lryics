[00:01.01]I think a lot of us look into the mirror
[00:04.02]And don't like what we see
[00:06.99]But I've been thinking and learning
[00:09.53]And friendship means looking past these things
[00:12.40]So keep your head held high
[00:15.46]And just stay by my side
[00:18.95]'Cause I've been watching and waiting
[00:22.01]And I think these things are worth saying
[00:25.16]You hold the door for me
[00:28.08]You spend your time on me~
[00:31.14]We laugh hysterically
[00:34.15]And I've been seeing
[00:37.16]You're always there for me
[00:40.13]You see me honestly~
[00:43.19]I think there's some thing, you have it
[00:46.11]I think that you've got magic
[00:48.98]You couldn't be self-centered even if you tried
[00:52.09]There's something~ that I see inside
[00:55.00]And you don't know~ I've been watching
[00:57.92]The way you fix people's hurting
[01:01.17]So stop the way you hate
[01:03.57]The way you act because I see~~~
[01:07.24]Something perfect in your smile~
[01:09.97]I know it's worth it all worthwhile
[01:13.17]You hold the door for me
[01:16.19]You spend your time on me~

[01:28.14]You see me honestly~
[01:31.16]I think there's something, you have it
[01:34.17]I think that you've got magic
[01:37.18]So come~ and follow me
[01:40.19]While we~ breathe harmony~~~
[01:43.16]And find it's meant to be
[01:46.17]We've got what the world all ne~eds
[01:49.18]So take my hand â€˜cause I~
[01:52.15]Still need~ you by my side~~~
[01:55.16]We've found the point at last and
[01:58.22]I think that we've got magic
[02:01.14]So come and march with me
[02:04.06]Let's spread~ this harmony~~~
[02:07.12]You'll never be that far from me~

[02:13.14]So take my hand, let's go
[02:16.06]There's something more I know~~~

[02:22.23]I think that you've got magic
[02:25.24]You hold my heart, it helps
[02:28.16]You share pieces of yourself
[02:31.12]When I hurt, you smile at me
[02:34.09]And I think I see that
[02:37.24]You never leave me there
[02:40.16]We can always clear the air~
[02:43.18]I think there's something, you have it
