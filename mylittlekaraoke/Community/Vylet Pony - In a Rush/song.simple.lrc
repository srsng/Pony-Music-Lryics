[00:25.73]Nobody thinks about the motive
[00:29.13]To another one's move
[00:32.38]Face value rears its head still
[00:35.53]You don't know the truth
[00:37.68]Oh oh
[00:38.48]And even then, I was still so scared
[00:41.83]Maybe I'm just that dumb

[01:10.88]'Cuz we're in a rush now baby
[01:14.13]And we're doing fine
[01:29.73]Maybe we were destined for difference
[01:33.28]Or maybe it's a lie

[01:39.53]And you'd hear me cry
[01:43.18]I was always everywhere
[01:45.88]In the world and in my mind
[01:49.38]With hearts as strong as horses
