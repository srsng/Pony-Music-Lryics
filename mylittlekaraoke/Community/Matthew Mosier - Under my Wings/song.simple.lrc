[00:07.69]The blue sky
[00:09.36]Is all I need
[00:11.02]The wind in my face
[00:12.77]And the warmth of the sun
[00:14.67]I'm just beaming
[00:22.81]Wherever I am to go~~
[00:26.18]I will know~~~ today~~
[00:30.75]If ever the world~ should slow
[00:34.52]I'll be in the sky making my own shade
[00:37.97]And I
[00:39.59]Will just fly~ away
[00:41.50]Let the breeze carry me
[00:43.92]Skyward dancing~
[00:45.86]And I
[00:47.33]Will just soar~ today
[00:49.24]Let the gusts of wind
[00:51.34]Glide under my wings~~~
[01:01.46]Freedom flies
[01:03.32]Fast and free
[01:04.75]The rain clouds are too slow
[01:06.82]And they will never catch up with me
[01:12.97]Catch up with me
[01:16.54]I'll drift beyond~ the sky~~~~
[01:20.19]Fill my lungs with untouched~ air~~
[01:24.44]Soar where there is no such war
[01:28.09]Not even the trees can reach us here
[01:31.70]And I
[01:33.40]Will just fly~ away
[01:35.27]Let the breeze carry me
[01:37.69]Skyward dancing~
[01:39.63]And I
[01:41.06]Will just soar~ today
[01:43.01]Let the gusts of wind
[01:45.11]Glide under my wings
[01:47.09]And I
[01:48.76]Will just fly~ away
[01:50.67]Let the breeze carry me
[01:53.05]Skyward dancing
[01:54.99]And I
[01:56.46]Will just soar~ today
[01:58.40]Let the gusts of wind
[02:00.47]Glide under my wings~~~
[02:18.21]Gotta leave Cloudsdale
[02:19.83]There's more than this home
[02:21.70]If you wanna see beauty
[02:23.76]Beyond what you've known
[02:25.94]Look to the moon
[02:27.25]As it sits in the sky
[02:29.52]The magic, the wonder
[02:31.38]Of floating on high
[02:34.83]...Will just fly~ away
[02:36.74]Let the breeze carry me
[02:39.16]Skyward dancing
[02:41.02]And I
[02:42.53]Will just soar~ today
[02:44.44]Let the gusts of wind
[02:46.54]Glide under my wings
[02:48.60]And I
[02:50.15]Will just fly~ away
[02:52.06]Let the breeze carry me
[02:54.52]Skyward dancing
[02:56.38]And I
[02:57.85]Will just soar~ today
[02:59.79]Let the gusts of wind
[03:01.94]Glide under my wings~~~
