[00:07.69][P1] The blue sky
[00:09.36][P1] Is all I need
[00:11.02][P1] The wind in my face
[00:12.77][P1] And the warmth of the sun
[00:14.67][P1] I'm just beaming
[00:22.81][P1] Wherever I am to go~~
[00:26.18][P1] I will know~~~ today~~
[00:30.75][P2] If ever the world~ should slow
[00:34.52][P2] I'll be in the sky making my own shade
[00:37.97][P1] And I
[00:39.59][P1] Will just fly~ away
[00:41.50][P1] Let the breeze carry me
[00:43.92][P1] Skyward dancing~
[00:45.86][P1] And I
[00:47.33][P1] Will just soar~ today
[00:49.24][P1] Let the gusts of wind
[00:51.34][P1] Glide under my wings~~~
[01:01.46][P2] Freedom flies
[01:03.32][P2] Fast and free
[01:04.75][P2] The rain clouds are too slow
[01:06.82][P2] And they will never catch up with me
[01:12.97][P2] Catch up with me
[01:16.54][P2] I'll drift beyond~ the sky~~~~
[01:20.19][P2] Fill my lungs with untouched~ air~~
[01:24.44][P1] Soar where there is no such war
[01:28.09][P1] Not even the trees can reach us here
[01:31.70][P2] And I
[01:33.40][P2] Will just fly~ away
[01:35.27][P2] Let the breeze carry me
[01:37.69][P2] Skyward dancing~
[01:39.63][P2] And I
[01:41.06][P2] Will just soar~ today
[01:43.01][P2] Let the gusts of wind
[01:45.11][P2] Glide under my wings
[01:47.09][P1] And I
[01:48.76][P1] Will just fly~ away
[01:50.67][P1] Let the breeze carry me
[01:53.05][P1] Skyward dancing
[01:54.99][P1] And I
[01:56.46][P1] Will just soar~ today
[01:58.40][P1] Let the gusts of wind
[02:00.47][P1] Glide under my wings~~~
[02:18.21][P2] Gotta leave Cloudsdale
[02:19.83][P2] There's more than this home
[02:21.70][P2] If you wanna see beauty
[02:23.76][P2] Beyond what you've known
[02:25.94][P2] Look to the moon
[02:27.25][P2] As it sits in the sky
[02:29.52][P2] The magic, the wonder
[02:31.38][P2] Of floating on high
[02:33.13][P1] And I
[02:34.83][P1] Will just fly~ away
[02:36.74][P1] Let the breeze carry me
[02:39.16][P1] Skyward dancing
[02:41.02][P1] And I
[02:42.53][P1] Will just soar~ today
[02:44.44][P1] Let the gusts of wind
[02:46.54][P1] Glide under my wings~~~
[02:48.52][P2] And I
[02:50.15][P2] Will just fly~ away
[02:52.06][P2] Let the breeze carry me
[02:54.52][P2] Skyward dancing
[02:56.38][P2] And I
[02:57.85][P2] Will just soar~ today
[02:59.79][P2] Let the gusts of wind
[03:01.94][P2] Glide under my wings~~~
