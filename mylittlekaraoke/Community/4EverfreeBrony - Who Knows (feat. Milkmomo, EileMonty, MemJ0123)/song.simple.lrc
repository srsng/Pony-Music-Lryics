[00:14.16]I know that something isn't right
[00:17.52]The moon is down, so where's the light?
[00:20.78]Nine a.m., it should be bri-i-ight
[00:26.63]Of all the things that could occur
[00:29.94]I still don't know what there is to learn
[00:32.91]Maybe my clock just overtu-u-urned
[00:39.09]Who knows when the sun will rise again?
[00:45.33]Seems we've got too much time to spend
[00:51.51]Feels like this night will never end
[00:55.65]I guess it just depends
[00:57.79]Who knows when the sun will rise again?
[01:04.02]My sister won't get out of bed
[01:07.38]What's in her mind? What's in her head?
[01:10.26]Seems she has other plans inste-e-ead
[01:16.49]She's always liked to play pretend
[01:19.61]But she should be up, it's almost ten
[01:23.11]And if not, what the-e-en?
[01:29.10]Who knows when the sun will rise again?
[01:35.19]Seems we've got too much time to spend
[01:41.42]Feels like this night will never end
[01:45.56]I guess it just depends
[01:47.65]Who knows when the sun will rise again?
[01:54.32]The world should sleep~ today
[02:00.56]Think I dese-erve a~ break
[02:06.45]You'll see, this way it's better
[02:09.52]We'll all just nap together
[02:12.63]The night will last forever
[02:15.46]THAT'S NOT FUNNY!
[02:18.82]Who knows when the sun will rise again?
[02:25.05]Seems we've got too much time to spend
[02:31.33]Feels like this night will never end
[02:35.42]I guess it just depends
[02:37.52]Who knows when the sun will rise again?
[02:43.80]Who knows when the sun will rise again?
[02:48.03]Sun will rise again
[02:49.98]Seems we've got too much time to spend
[02:54.22]Too much time to spend
[02:56.26]Feels like this night will never end
[03:00.35]I guess it just depends
[03:02.45]Who knows when the sun will rise again~~~~?
[03:08.68]Who cares if the sun will rise again?
[03:11.84]Wha--!? What meanest thou!?
[03:14.52]Everypony cares, do they not?
[03:16.32]*sigh* Oh, so be it...
[03:18.76]They can't let a princess sleep in just once, it seems
[03:22.36]Sleep in!? T'is ten thirty!
[03:24.89]We are quite certain that thou hast already done a fine job of sleeping in!
[03:30.10]Yes, I suppose...
[03:32.54]Well, up with the sun then...
[03:35.02]Really, sister...?
[03:36.48]What?
[03:37.46]It is thy calling
[03:39.26]I should get a break, shouldn't I?
[03:41.40]I mean, I can have you raise the sun for a while to make up for lost time, right?
[03:45.98]What!? How canst thou say such a thing!?!?
[03:49.53]*sigh* Fine, fine...
[03:51.58]Perhaps I am acting a bit childish this morning...
[03:54.89]Hah... At least it's still morning, you know
[03:58.20]...Thou art too old for this.
