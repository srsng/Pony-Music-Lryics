[00:27.40]If I could write a letter to~ myself toda~y
[00:32.80]I would tell myself to not lo~se hope
[00:36.02]And tell myself to stay
[00:39.33]If I could ma~il my heart to myself toda~y
[00:44.72]I would tell it to stop sinking
[00:47.95]When all they say is I'm not thinking
[00:51.40]I don't know what could've gone wrong
[00:54.47]When I kept you waiting by your mailbox
[00:58.67]All da~y long
[01:02.27]Am I so different?
[01:05.31]Am I so different?
[01:08.80]When I'm looking up while looking down
[01:12.10]I won't be dragged into the ground
[01:27.70]If I could make myself look straight toda~y
[01:33.10]I would hold my breath and close my eyes
[01:36.32]Cross my he~art and hope to~ die
[01:39.70]If I could ma~ke myself think straight toda~y
[01:45.03]I would walk a mile and say hello
[01:48.25]To every friend I've ever known
[01:51.55]I don't know what could've gone wrong
[01:54.62]When I kept you waiting at your mailbox
[01:58.82]All da~y long
[02:03.55]I don't know what could've gone wrong
[02:06.62]When I kept you waiting by your ma~ilbox
[02:10.90]All da~y long
[02:14.65]Am I so different?
[02:17.65]Am I so different?
[02:21.03]When I'm looking up while looking down
[02:24.25]I won't be dragged into the ground
[02:26.80]And they make me
[02:29.50]Feel like I don't belong
[02:32.88]But what they say won't change my feelings
[02:36.25]There is no one I'd rather be than me
[03:02.43]Am I so different?
[03:05.58]Am I so different?
[03:08.95]When I'm looking up while looking down
[03:12.25]I won't be dragged into the ground
[03:14.80]And they make me
[03:17.50]Feel like I don't belong
[03:20.88]But what they say won't change my feelings
[03:24.03]There's no one I would rather be than me
