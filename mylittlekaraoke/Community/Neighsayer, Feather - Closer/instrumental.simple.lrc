[00:00.77]Greet the early morning glow
[00:07.03]Before the sun~ kisses the hills
[00:13.59]Brother, Sister, Gran in~ tow
[00:19.97]Times like these I remember them still
[00:26.34]Sweat dripping off my back
[00:32.57]We work the hours of the sun
[00:39.21]Bundle up the dry hay stacks
[00:45.62]We don't rest up until we're done~~
[00:51.99]Grittin' teeth and burning sides
[00:58.14]The trees tremble at my hoof
[01:04.56]I take the pain in my~ stride
[01:10.93]I feel them here~, don't need no proof
[01:16.78]Lay me down~ on golden~ fields
[01:24.02]Rest my head down on the barley
[01:30.43]Feel the sun upon my face
[01:36.73]Watch the clouds~ a~~bove me race~~
[01:43.18]Feel the sun upon my face
[01:49.52]Watch the clouds~ a~bove me race~~
[01:56.34]And feel you closer than ever
[02:08.68]I whisper while the apples~ fall
[02:15.09]Pretend that it's you who speaks
[02:21.47]I know you won't answer when I~ call
[02:27.69]But I think you're there~ within the leaves~~
[02:34.41]Feel the sun upon my face
[02:40.74]Watch the clouds~ a~bove me race~~
[02:47.19]Feel the sun upon my face
[02:53.57]Watch the clouds~ a~bove me race~~
[03:00.39]And feel you closer than ever
[03:12.81]You don't talk so much with~ words
[03:19.18]As you do with summer breeze
[03:25.22]That rests 'neath the wings of the~ birds
[03:31.78]You move with grace and you move with ease~~
[03:38.01]Guess that's what happens when you die
[03:44.79]And you're gone much too soon
[03:50.98]You leave a feather while you fly
[03:57.66]For your loved ones to remember you by~~
[04:03.17]Lay me~ down~ on golden fields
[04:10.41]Rest my head down on the barley
[04:16.86]Feel the sun upon my face~~
[04:23.16]Watch the clouds a~bove me race~~
[04:29.64]Feel the sun upon my face~~
[04:35.98]Watch the clouds a~bove me race~~
[04:42.84]And feel you closer than ever
[04:55.63]I feel you closer
