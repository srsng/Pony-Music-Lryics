Breaking the dawn
Bright days~ spread
You~ earthly po~ny~
You saw~ them
The~ sun
She'll raise~, weâ€™re run~ning
Through open fields~
And distant moun~tains
Fall~ air~
Air, air, air
Air~
Air, air, air
Oooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh~ ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh~ ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh~ ooh
Ooh ooh
Peace in the wild so solemn
The~ blades and flowers sway calmly
All~ things alive, created
A wondrous sight~, so was~ted
Flow air~, air~~
Shake trees~
Soothless neighsayer
Flow air~, air~~
Moonlight~~
Glowing~ there~~
