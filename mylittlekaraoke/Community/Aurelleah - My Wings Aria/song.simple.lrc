[00:14.86]Shining Armor, you told me not to cry
[00:19.47]But it's so hard
[00:26.11]Ev'ry day that passes by
[00:30.01]Hurts more at my~~ heart
[00:37.40]Shining Armor, I know you meant your best
[00:42.01]When you stayed behind
[00:48.38]Without your heartfelt sacrifice
[00:52.59]We might not've had the time
[00:58.21]But it still hurts, waking up without you here
[01:05.63]Even spells can't quell the fear
[01:10.55]That I might not get to see~ your face
[01:15.91]Or fall asleep held in your~ em~brace, ever again
[01:25.81]Or hear you tell me
[01:29.30]About your hopes~, your fears, your dreams
[01:34.25]But although it's been so long
[01:37.06]My hope~ still runs strong~
[01:39.83]So I'll keep searching on...
[01:46.58]My wings will carry our weight
[01:52.58]No matter how much they ache
[01:56.86]And I will never stop sear~ching the world~
[02:02.48]For signs of your escape
[02:09.38]And if, the darkness would come
[02:14.45]And claim the hope~ that spurs me on
[02:19.40]I'll spend all of my days, wai~ting~ for~
[02:25.06]The one who made my life
[02:30.76]A life worth fighting for
