It's so complicated
He's evil, let's face it
But I know he'll reform
Just give him the chance
Now if you wanna be kind, it'll take some steps so
Take a seat and I'll explain the rest
Just be polite, don't bring the worst and um, well,
You gotta pay attention first...
There's a way to show kindness and trust
Without playing those tricks and rain chaos on us
No need for those insults, just give it a try
Oh, there's gotta be some kind of compassion inside!
La la la la la, aahh
Though it's hard to make it there,
Don't hide you care
I know you'll be fine
Aahh, la la la la la
Use your magic for the best,
And see the rest
Believe in you in no time!
Thank you Discord for showing me
That sweetest side that I can now see
Keeping our promise all the more
'Cause that's what friends are for!
It's so complicated
He's evil, let's face it
But I know he'll reform
Just give him the chance
So let out that kindness
Don't forget where your heart is
And it's not bad! Understand
The friendship we have!
