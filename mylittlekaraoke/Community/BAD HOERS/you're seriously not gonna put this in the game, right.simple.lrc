[00:03.13]Who's it from, Twilight?
[00:04.58]What's it say?
[00:05.52]It's from
[00:05.89]Bad Horse, Bad Horse
[00:07.39]Bad Horse, Bad Horse
[00:08.89]He rides across the nation
[00:10.39]The thoroughbred of sin
[00:11.94]He got the application
[00:13.20]That you just sent in
[00:14.94]It needs evaluation
[00:16.39]So let the games begin
[00:17.99]A heinous crime, a show of force
[00:19.53]A murder would be nice of course
[00:20.94]Bad Horse
[00:21.69]Bad Horse
[00:22.44]Bad Horse
[00:23.14]He's bad
[00:23.94]The Evil League of Evil
[00:25.44]Is watching so beware
[00:26.94]The grade that you receive
[00:28.06]Will be your last we swear
[00:29.89]So make the Bad Horse gleeful
[00:31.44]Or he'll make you his mare
[00:33.69]You're saddled up
[00:34.49]There's no recourse
[00:35.24]It's Hi-Ho, Silver!
[00:36.08]Signed, Bad Horse
[00:37.30]That's all there is
