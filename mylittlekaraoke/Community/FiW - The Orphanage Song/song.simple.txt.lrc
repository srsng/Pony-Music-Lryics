Step one try not to be so selfconscious
Two shift your weight into your haunches
Three give a leap into the air and
Four just forget your parents are both dead
Chin up even if you're not adopted
It's not because you are unwanted
But it might help if you were magic
Not just a boring ugly
Pink earth pony who nopony will ever love
Because you're unworthy
