[00:30.64]The little filly was all alone
[00:34.14]She felt the wind and she longed to follow
[00:37.69]"Her scrawny wings were too small" they said
[00:41.30]"And she will never ascend like other"
[00:45.02]But she looked up
[00:47.68]And she spread her precious golden wings
[00:52.29]And in her heart there burned a fi-re
[00:59.28]Then she took to the sky!
[01:01.06]Rising...
[01:02.83]Soaring...
[01:04.61]Dreaming...
[01:06.33]Burning!
[01:07.94]You'll never hold me back the Spirit of Fi-re
[01:11.49]I am invincible, I'm flying, and I am free!
[01:15.05]I'm never turning back, the Spirit of Fi-re
[01:18.66]My dreams are all I need, my passion will be the key!

[01:36.36]Another pony at school was cruel
[01:39.97]He thought that he was the greatest flyer
[01:43.58]"You'll never win in a race with me"
[01:47.08]"I will defeat you just try and see~"
[01:50.80]She felt no fear
[01:53.52]As she marched up to the starting line
[01:58.01]And in her eyes, there burned a fi-re
[02:05.06]Then she took to the sky!
[02:06.84]Rising...
[02:08.61]Soaring...
[02:10.39]Dreaming...
[02:12.11]Burning!
[02:13.72]You'll never hold me back the Spirit of Fi-re
[02:17.27]I am invincible, I'm flying, and I am free!
[02:20.83]I'm never turning back, the Spirit of Fi-re
[02:24.38]My dreams are all I need, my passion will be the key!

[03:17.73]You'll never hold me back the Spirit of Fi-re
[03:21.28]I am invincible, I'm flying, and I am free!
[03:24.83]I'm never turning back, the Spirit of Fi-re
[03:28.38]My dreams are all I need, my passion will be the key!
