[00:03.83]I'm turning nine tonightâ€¦
[00:06.57]Happy Birthday, Dusk!
[00:13.38]Time to explore a-all the secrets
[00:16.42]Today I am a kid no more
[00:19.88]This destiny ca-alls out to-o me-e
[00:23.33]After those years I'll smile and so-oar
[00:32.98]I'll follow the path a-and the hoofsteps
[00:36.33]Left behind by my great-grand-father
[00:39.68]I'll discover
[00:41.20]What my grand-father did to gain such a
[00:44.86]Huge po-ower
[00:49.99]Today I start my jo-ourney
[00:52.88]Never to stop until I find
[00:56.13]What has happened to my father
[00:59.38]Who I am, and my peace of mi-i-ind
[01:05.93]Illusions? Dark powers? What a shame.
[01:10.60]I expected something... different.
[01:16.34]Well, I can work with that.
[01:25.68]Of course you do, my-y little one!
[01:28.83]Don't be afraid, for you are me
[01:32.44]Pleased to meet you!
[01:33.96]And this will be so fun...
[01:35.69]And we are just two fri-ends to be-e-e-e, ah
[01:42.19]But I am the price for those po-wers
[01:45.49]Invincible!
[01:47.37]That is a fact!
[01:48.74]I'll borrow that body of ours
[01:51.89]And don't go thinking you can fi-ight back.
[01:55.74]"I won't let you, you mean monster!"
[01:58.49]I doubt that friend, just look at me
[02:02.09]You're the student and I-I'm the master
[02:05.19]So sit down, freeze, and let me be, ah
[02:11.33]Who do you think I am, you weakling?
[02:14.58]You are just a toy in my hoo-o-of
[02:17.78]A-all the magic, I am the king
[02:20.88]And your demise will be the pro-of
[02:24.53]HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!
[02:27.28]I must admit I'm having quite a good time!
[02:30.78]Today's forecast: black clouds!
[02:33.73]Witness the return of the curse
[02:36.92]Celestia's blind and won't notice
[02:40.17]The threat that will make all things worse
[02:44.49]Hahaha!
[02:45.61]Turn off the lights, run away
[02:48.45]Hide yourself far, gallop and flee
[02:51.70]I will catch you, you are my prey
[02:55.15]Powerless to stop, ah, what you see-e
[03:11.55]Hear my words and be afraid
[03:14.91]There will soon be no place to hi-ide
[03:18.16]From the shadows a-and the te-error
[03:21.25]They will all fall with darkness on my-y-y si-i-i-ide
[03:29.07]My si-ide
[03:31.20]I've got a-all the darkness on my si-i-i-i-ide...
[03:36.18]?????????????
[03:40.45]HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
[03:42.78]AH,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
