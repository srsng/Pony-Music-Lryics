[00:47.45]I gaze~ upon the sky
[00:51.82]I see the clouds see the pegasi~
[00:59.85]I want to soar I want to fly
[01:05.74]And see the horizon far
[01:12.36]I can on~ly dream of what I~ don't know
[01:23.31]And never will know
[01:27.04]I'll never know I'll never know
[01:57.61]I gaze~ upon the sky
[02:01.95]I see the clouds see the pegasi~
[02:10.09]I want to soar I want to fly
[02:15.94]And see the horizon far
[02:22.56]I can on~ly dream of what I~ don't know
[02:33.51]And never will know
[02:37.12] I'll never know I'll never know
