I gaze~ upon the sky
I see the clouds see the pegasi~
I want to soar I want to fly
And see the horizon far
I can on~ly dream of what I~ don't know
And never will know
I'll never know I'll never know
I gaze~ upon the sky
I see the clouds see the pegasi~
I want to soar I want to fly
And see the horizon far
I can on~ly dream of what I~ don't know
And never will know
I'll never know I'll never know
Ah~~~ ah~~~~
Ah~~~ ah~~~~
Ah~~~ ah~~~~
