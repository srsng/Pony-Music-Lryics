[00:14.97]Missing? Goodness, no!
[00:17.47]I have been right here all along
[00:21.35]Well, I stepped out for a moment
[00:25.16]But I'm back where I belong
[00:28.85]Yes, I, the one you care for
[00:32.27]Really, who else would I be?
[00:35.97]Now just relax, my darling
[00:39.54]And give all your love to me
[00:45.00]This room is rather cozy
[00:48.16]And this clothing's awfully nice
[00:51.74]Your affection is delectable
[00:56.00]I think this will suffice
[00:59.81]Call me a romantic
[01:02.85]But I feel we're quite the pair
[01:06.89]Me, the changeling succubus
[01:09.93]And you, the unaware
[01:13.74]So feed me with your heart
[01:16.54]My sweet, unwitting devotee
[01:20.81]You've someone else in mind
[01:23.89]But it's alright with me
[01:27.93]Just give yourself completely
[01:31.35]I'll take all you have and more
[01:35.20]You'll love me like you've never loved before
[01:45.93]I wear this borrowed face
[01:48.66]That says I'm sweet and safe and kind
[01:52.70]For I fear that you'd be fearful of
[01:56.70]The thing that lies behind
[02:00.66]Moth-eaten and sickly
[02:03.66]Matted tresses, sharpened teeth
[02:07.08]Slitted eyes of green with charcoal skin
[02:10.97]And ashen heart beneath
[02:16.35]My hunger springs eter~nal
[02:19.47]I've an emptiness inside
[02:23.62]I pray that I may prey on you
[02:27.35]Until I'm satisfied
[02:31.04]I care not for flesh, nor I
[02:34.35]For fruit, or leaf, or seed
[02:37.43]No, I feast on your devo~tion, dear
[02:41.70]Your love is all~ I need
[02:44.66]So feed me with your heart
[02:48.04]My sweet, unwitting devotee
[02:52.43]You've someone else in mind
[02:55.43]But it's alright with me
[02:59.50]Your parasitic paramour
[03:03.35]Will steal your heart and then
[03:06.81]I'll leave you
[03:08.43]And you'll never love again
[03:28.20]Your parasitic paramour
[03:32.00]Will steal your heart and then
[03:35.31]I'll leave you, and you'll never love again
[03:42.62]You'll love me, then you'll never love again
