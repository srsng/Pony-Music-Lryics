[00:27.93]Caught in a trap, a magic spell
[00:31.13]I've got an urge that I can't quell
[00:34.33]I am a prisoner to~ the beat~
[00:40.73]I am a slave and it's absurd
[00:43.88]I simply cannot fight the words
[00:47.48]Rhythmically moving my feet~
[00:53.58]That pulsing beat, it carries on
[00:56.78]I could be here until the dawn
[01:00.28]Back and forth and back I sway
[01:06.33]That pulsing beat comes from above
[01:09.73]A gentle hand turned to a shove
[01:12.88]And I might never get away
[01:18.93]You sweep and sweep and sweep and sweep that floor
[01:22.08]You sweep and sweep until you can't sweep no more
[01:25.33]You sweep and sweep and sweep until you're sore
[01:28.53]Dust is the enemy and you're at war
[01:31.73]You sweep and sweep and sweep and sweep that room
[01:34.93]You sweep until you've worn down the entire broom
[01:38.13]You keep on sweeping and I assume
[01:41.28]You'll keep sweeping until your doom
[01:57.53]Caught in a trap that I can't break
[02:00.68]It's sad, it seems this is my fate
[02:03.88]So I guess I'll just sweep sweep sweep~
[02:10.33]I'm a prisoner I can't escape
[02:13.53]My life's no longer mine to shape
[02:16.68]If you cry for me, you better weep~
[02:23.08]That pulsing beat, it carries on
[02:26.28]I could be here until the dawn
[02:29.88]Back and forth and back I sway~
[02:35.93]That pulsing beat comes from above
[02:39.28]A gentle hand turned to a shove
[02:42.73]I might never get away
[02:48.53]You sweep and sweep and sweep and sweep that floor
[02:51.73]You sweep and sweep until you can't sweep no more
[02:54.93]You sweep and sweep and sweep until you're sore
[02:58.13]Dust is the enemy and you're at war
[03:01.33]You sweep and sweep and sweep and sweep that room
[03:04.53]You sweep until you've worn down the entire broom
[03:07.73]You keep on sweeping and I assume
[03:10.88]You'll keep sweeping until~ your~ doom
