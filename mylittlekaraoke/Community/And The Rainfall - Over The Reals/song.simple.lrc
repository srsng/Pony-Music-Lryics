[00:09.71]Shame, disembodied
[00:10.86]But still lingering as she rides into the land
[00:16.01]Shame, and not the mocking pride
[00:17.46]With which she used to pave the roads she went about
[00:22.66]But what's a pony to do
[00:24.21]Oh, what's a pony to do
[00:25.61]When the sun only shines for her
[00:28.21]And she can say "I'm the most"
[00:29.81]And lean on a truth
[00:31.01]That crumbles outside her lips
[00:41.51]Laying in the dim~ light
[00:44.76]Thinking up ways~ to fit the stars in her cape~
[00:47.96]Think that such dim light~
[00:50.91]Can shatter the mistakes that poison her wake?
[00:54.56]But what's a pony to do
[00:56.16]Oh, what's a pony to do
[00:57.66]When fire won't burn for her anymore
[01:00.21]When even dust runs out and the space left in its place
[01:04.01]Turns to question her
[01:06.61]And says
[01:07.96]"What's your story about~?
[01:12.96]Will you see it to a dichotomic end:
[01:17.16]The ground or the sky~?
[01:20.36]Are you a name or a life?
[01:23.36]Here's to you~: here's to rot and decay
[01:25.81]Here's to your jewels in flames~
[01:27.61]Here's to your naked name
[01:29.76]Pull through~; save a meaning for your words
[01:32.41]Find a saving spell
[01:33.61]In the vacuum that expands around you."
[01:45.66]Every roadsign cuts a little deeper
[01:48.66]The rough winds cheapen the careful finish
[01:51.01]And strip the polish coat after coat
[01:53.86]A figure unlike its mold!
[01:55.61]Sand that crumbles can't make a stand!
[01:57.96]Scattered sand cannot make amends!
[01:59.96]The look behind bars tells a story it shouldn't know
[02:04.86]Two pearls on the hori~zon
[02:09.66]Light up hidden veins
[02:12.36](fundamental avenues)
[02:15.21]A subject stands at the edge~ of a world
[02:19.56]Wishing to cross
[02:21.56]Leap over the gap
[02:24.66]But when she does she doesn't understand what she sees~
[02:29.96]"Is this all~ there is to be found around here~?"
[02:34.81]Asking on~tological questions
[02:38.36]To make sense ofâ€¦
[02:45.61]Say
[02:55.21]Where does green end and blue begin~?
[03:17.61]Deep into the night it's no longer dark outside
[03:24.26]Aware of field lines that extend beyond the edges of her mind~
[03:30.61]It doesn't matter where her thoughts are pointed
[03:33.56]She picks up a message that when decoded
[03:36.81]Delivers a song, yes, a song's all she hears
[03:43.21]Everything turns off and a song's all she hears
[04:08.61]Just shine, it's just everyone, every flock, every pony
[04:12.01]Every pony, nothing's easy
[04:14.41]Nothing's too hard with everyone's love, it's just love, it's every pony
[04:18.41]Every pony, every seed~
[04:21.41]Just shine, it's just everyone, every flock, every pony
[04:24.81]Every pony, nothing's easy
[04:27.21]Nothing's too hard with everyone's love, it's just love, it's every pony
[04:31.26]Every pony, every seed~
[04:59.81]Just shine, it's just everyone, every flock, every pony
[05:03.26]Every pony, nothing's easy
[05:05.66]Nothing's too hard with everyone's love, it's just love, it's every pony
[05:09.66]Every pony, every seed~
