Meet me in the cold
With nothing to say
Someday I'll come home
I will find my way
Through the coldest winds
With winter emptiness
Darkness closing in
The snow encompasses
Hold me in your hooves
When my light burns dim
To walk another step
Or fall down and give in
Holding by a thread
Of changes yet to come
Brighter days to bring
The shining sun will sing
Oh~, endless winds
Timeless breeze
Caving in
Is not the way for me
Oh, the sun
The sun will ri~se
And winter, cease
And from this, a light will be released
Out here in the cold
I stand alone as one
Someday I'll come home
When I raise the sun
