[00:08.22]It's time you learned a lesson
[00:12.05]It's time that you understand~
[00:15.95]Don't ever count on anybody else
[00:19.25]In this or any other land
[00:23.45]I once hoped for friendship
[00:26.30]To find a place among my kind~
[00:31.06]But those were the childish wishes
[00:34.44]Of someone who was blind
[00:37.55]Open up your-
[00:38.60]Ah!
[00:42.31]Ah!
[00:46.21]A~h!
[00:50.00]A~e~a~e~a~h!
[00:54.12]A~~~~~~~~h!
[01:03.20]Oh!
[01:05.15]A~~h!
[01:09.42]See the world~ from where I stand
[01:12.80]Me, among the mighty
[01:15.20]You, caged at my command~
[01:20.45]Open up your eyes~~
[01:24.50]Give up your sweet fantasy land
[01:28.17]It's time to grow up and get wise
[01:32.22]Come now little one
[01:34.74]Open up your eyes
[01:41.07]We all start out the same
[01:44.00]With simple naive trust
[01:48.46]Shielded from the many ways
[01:51.57]That life's not fair or just
[01:55.96]But then there comes a moment
[01:58.74]A simple truth that you must face
[02:02.90]If you depend~ on others
[02:06.80]You'll never find~ your place
[02:36.39]And as you take that first step
[02:39.24]Upon a path that's all your own
[02:43.32]You see it all so clear~ly
[02:47.19]The best way to survive is all alone
[02:54.27]Open up your eyes~~
[02:58.62]See the world~ from where I stand
[03:01.96]Me, among the mighty
[03:04.29]You, caged at my command~
[03:09.50]Open up your eyes~~
[03:13.74]And behold the faded light
[03:17.37]It's time to grow up and get wise
[03:21.24]Come now, little one
[03:23.86]Open up your eyes
[03:31.47]Open up your eyes
