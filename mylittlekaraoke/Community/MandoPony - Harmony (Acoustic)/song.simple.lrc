[00:04.27]Maybe I'm too young
[00:06.61]To really understand or
[00:09.17]Maybe I'm too old to let it go
[00:13.96]Maybe I'm too jaded
[00:16.06]Never appreciated
[00:18.51]The little things you a-already know
[00:23.55]I can see the wonder
[00:26.21]Shining in your face
[00:28.27]But it's not in me anymore
[00:32.93]With a tiny glance
[00:34.96]I get a second chance
[00:37.69]I remember what I was searching for
[00:41.12]When I look i-in your eyes
[00:44.83]I can see what I could be
[00:50.28]When I hear you-ur words
[00:53.89]I hear the sou-und of harmony-y
[00:58.89]And I want to lea-arn from you
[01:02.60]The wisdo-om in your hea-art
[01:08.06]And no matter where we go-o
[01:12.33]We will never be apa-a-a-art
[01:36.90]Little laughs, little smiles
[01:39.21]Bring me back a thousand miles
[01:41.52]To a place a lifeti-ime away
[01:46.14]To a time when I was free
[01:48.24]To be whatever I could be
[01:50.48]To say whatever I wanted to-o say
[01:54.99]I think I lost it
[01:56.25]Somewhere along the-e line
[01:58.77]But I can find it once mo-o-ore
[02:03.88]You give me one mo-ore glance,
[02:05.94]And I get another second chance
[02:08.67]I remember what I was searching for
[02:12.03]When I look i-in your eyes
[02:15.81]I can see-e what I used to-o be
[02:21.13]When I hear you-ur words
[02:24.77]I remember harmony-y
[02:29.88]And I want to lea-arn from you
[02:33.62]All the-e wisdom in your heart
[02:38.84]And no matter where we go-o
[02:43.04]We will never be apa-art
[03:08.83]I miss your eyes
[03:11.87]And the-e way we used to be
[03:17.72]I can't hea-ar your words,
[03:20.48]But I remember harmony-y
[03:25.80]And I sti-ill will learn from you-u
[03:29.44]And all the wisdo-om in your heart
[03:34.69]And no matter ho-ow you gro-ow
[03:38.89]We will never really be-e apart
[03:44.21]Never really be-e apart
