Maybe I'm too young
To really understand or
Maybe I'm too old to let it go
Maybe I'm too jaded
Never appreciated
The little things you already know
I can see the wonder
Shining in your face
But it's not in me anymore
With a tiny glance
I get a second chance
I remember what I was searching for
When I look in your eyes
I can see what I could be
When I hear your words
I hear the sound of harmony
And I want to learn from you
The wisdom in your heart
And no matter where we go
We will never be apart
Little laughs, little smiles
Bring me back a thousand miles
To a place a lifetime away
To a time when I was free
To be whatever I could be
To say whatever I wanted to say
I think I lost it
Somewhere along the line
But I can find it once more
You give me one more glance,
And I get another second chance
I remember what I was searching for
When I look in your eyes
I can see what I used to be
When I hear your words
I remember harmony
And I want to learn from you
All the wisdom in your heart
And no matter where we go
We will never be apart
I miss your eyes
And the way we used to be
I can't hear your words,
But I remember harmony
And I still will learn from you
And all the wisdom in your heart
And no matter how you grow
We will never really be apart
Never really be apart
