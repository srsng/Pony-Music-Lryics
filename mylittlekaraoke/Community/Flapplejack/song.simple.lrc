[00:01.48]See, this gate here used to squeak so loud
[00:03.35]The pigs would run to the other side of the
[00:04.84]pen and never come out!
[00:06.21]So I open and close it to let them know it's safe
[00:08.77]But it doesn't squeak any more
[00:10.83]Of course not!
[00:12.07]I fixed that ages ago
[00:15.07]Then, I realized putting a little fright into 'em
[00:35.76]It's late and I'm awake
[00:40.06]Staring at the wall
[00:43.99]Open up my window
[00:47.97]Head floats out the door
[00:52.03]No one else around
[00:55.45]The shimmer takes my-y eye
[01:00.44]I lift my he-
[01:07.98]Feel my weight in front
[01:12.03]Following the sound
[01:16.08]Moves away so fast
[01:20.07]Fall down to the ground
[01:23.81]I know there's more to come
[01:28.05]Jump back to my feet
[01:31.48]Now I only see ahead of me
[01:36.03]Chasing down the street
