See, this gate here used to squeak so loud
The pigs would run to the other side of the
pen and never come out!
So I open and close it to let them know it's safe
But it doesn't squeak any more
Of course not!
I fixed that ages ago
Then, I realized putting a little fright into 'em
It's late and I'm awake
Staring at the wall
Open up my window
Head floats out the door
No one else around
The shimmer takes my eye
I lift my he
Feel my weight in front
Following the sound
Moves away so fast
Fall down to the ground
I know there's more to come
Jump back to my feet
Now I only see ahead of me
Chasing down the street
