[00:28.30]I've traveled across the land
[00:31.05]From the arctic ice to the scalding sand
[00:36.30]I've been following the silhouette
[00:39.05]I've seen in my dreams, like heaven-sent
[00:44.30]So far away from home
[00:48.30]Kept travelling alone
[00:52.05]I'd run anywhere just to see her once again
[00:58.30]My Princess of the Sun
[00:59.80]What happened to the magic lands
[01:01.80]After these harrowing events
[01:03.80]For once abandoned by the sun
[01:05.80]It's gone, and no one knows why!
[01:07.80]There must be something really wrong
[01:09.80]How could she disappear for so long
[01:13.05]And leave us on our own?
[01:25.30]My path has led me to a weird~ place
[01:29.30]That kind that shocks with its dark beauty and grace
[01:33.30]She walked in slowly~, hiding her~ face
[01:37.30]The way she sneaked away on one of those daysâ€¦
[01:41.30]I still recall that rainy night
[01:43.30]When they've been bitten by own fright
[01:45.30]Her sister moans beneath the Sun
[01:47.30]But she is staying strong and calm
[01:49.30]I bowed to her and placed that heavy crown upon her head
[01:55.80]To serve her till the end
[01:57.30]What happened to her royal air?
[01:59.30]Her mighty form's no longer there
[02:01.30]It filled us all with faith and hope
[02:03.30]Seems like her heart is dying!
[02:05.30]There must be something really wrong
[02:07.30]She took away her hood and turned
[02:09.30]I don't recall the last time she was crying!
