[00:16.83]Every time your sun sets do you feel regret
[00:24.10]For what happened in centuries past

[00:36.87]Do you know why she chose that path?

[01:18.05]Every time the moon is full can you feel the pull
[01:24.78]Of your little sister in need?
[01:31.28]Keep your smile~ to hide turmoil~
[01:36.79]Hidden deep underneath~~~
