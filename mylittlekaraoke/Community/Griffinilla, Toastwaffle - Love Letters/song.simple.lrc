[00:33.60]And when you're blue, she will send an "I love you"
[00:37.72]And if you're not, X-O-X-O marks the spot
[00:41.93]Like hidden treasure there's a letter unfettered
[00:45.60]But how did she break into my house?
[00:49.07](oh no... did she climb in through my chimney??)
[00:52.11]Drop a note right in her ask box
[00:54.22]She can't speak but she's got sweet talk
[00:56.22]Spreading her love letters through the town
[01:00.48]Coat is pink and mane is stripey
[01:02.49]Neck so long it's kinda frightening!
[01:04.54]Spreading her love letters through the town
[01:25.79]That Dissy Dee, she can be rather angry
[01:29.90]She said, "Enough!" then she left in a big huff
[01:34.11]Our poor Love Letters knit a sweater to get her
[01:37.79]But Dissy uses it as a mop
[01:41.46](she pretends she doesn't like it, but she does)
[01:44.30]She writes letters, decked in glitter
[01:46.35]Hearts and stars and smiling stickers
[01:48.41]Spreading her love letters through the town
[01:52.62]She wears perfume like a sunscreen
[01:54.72]Don't get trapped inside her love beams!
[01:56.78]Spreading her love letters through the town
[02:26.01]Valentine's gets her excited
[02:28.11]Once a year she's in the limelight
[02:30.12]Spreading her love letters through the town
[03:07.77]Friendly gift or imposition?
[03:09.87]Pupil hearts or eye condition?
[03:11.93]Never can be too sure in this town
[03:16.09]She sells gift cards as a business
[03:18.24]Cheers you up with hugs and kisses
[03:20.25]Barely turns a profit in this town
[03:43.94]X- O- X- O, love is ipso facto
[03:49.62]Love unconditionally
[03:55.30]X- O- X- O, love is ipso facto
[04:01.03]Love unconditionally
[04:06.61]la la la la lalalala la la
[04:12.49]la lalalalala la
[04:18.21]la la la la lalalala la love
[04:24.09]love unconditionally
