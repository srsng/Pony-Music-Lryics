[00:30.23]The sound of every beating heart
[00:33.23]Is music to my ears
[00:36.23]The melody is torn apart
[00:39.19]When listening through tears
[00:43.20]Is it too soon~, or am I too late?
[00:46.28]How have I done?
[00:48.98]The words still echo
[00:51.00]But I'm not repeating one
[00:54.53]This is who I'm meant to be
[01:00.53]Raise that sun so I can see
[01:06.22]Again
[01:09.49]One by~ one
[01:15.49]Days seem longer
[01:21.49]Let me~ run
[01:27.45]Let me~ wander
[01:45.19]I wish to leave it all ~behind
[01:48.07]And never to return
[01:51.19]It seems avoiding what is mine
[01:54.19]Is not the way to learn
[01:57.45]Ring around the rosie
[02:00.45]No one really knows me
[02:03.53]Ashes to ashes
[02:06.19]The walls fall down
[02:09.45]This is who I'm meant to be
[02:15.56]I am lost so mental~ly
[02:21.15]Again
[02:24.53]One by~one
[02:30.49]Days seem longer
[02:36.49]Let me~ run
[02:42.49]Let me~ wander
[03:12.49]One by~ one
[03:18.45]Days seem longer
[03:24.53]Let me~ run
[03:30.86]Let me~ wander
