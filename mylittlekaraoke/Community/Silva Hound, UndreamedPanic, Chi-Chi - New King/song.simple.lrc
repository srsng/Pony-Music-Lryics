[00:01.57]I've waited from beginning to end~
[00:05.56]Now begins the renaissance
[00:09.31]Enemies are turning to friends~
[00:12.86]And everybody sings along
[00:16.85]No matter how many times we fell down
[00:20.13]You~ rise and get stronger each time~
[00:24.07]'Cause no matter what
[00:25.72]You~ never gave up on love~
[00:29.58]And it's unbelie~vable~
[00:33.06]How you made the change
[00:34.47]And showed me a world of new~ things
[00:37.00]And it's inconcei~vable~
[00:40.56]How you caught my heart
[00:42.16]How you became my new~ king

[01:33.02]How you made the change

[01:50.29]Our troubled past is almost gone
[01:54.11]The shadows all around us contend~
[01:57.86]But we continue pressing on
