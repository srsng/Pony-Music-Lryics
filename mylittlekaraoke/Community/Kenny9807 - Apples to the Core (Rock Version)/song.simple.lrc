[00:14.29]We've traveled the-e road of generations
[00:17.99]Joined by common bo-ond
[00:21.20]We sing o-ur song 'cross the pony nation
[00:24.47]From Equestria and be-eyond
[00:28.06]We're Apples forever, Apples together
[00:31.49]We're fam'ly but so much mo-ore
[00:34.92]No matter what comes, we will face the weather
[00:38.34]We're Apples to the-e core
[00:41.99]There's no-o place that I'd rathe-er be
[00:45.20]Than travelling with my family
[00:48.74]Friends all around come to join and see
[00:51.79]As we sing along 'cross the-e land
[00:55.54]We're Apples forever, Apples together
[00:58.91]We're fam'ly but so much mo-ore
[01:02.34]No matter what comes, we will face the weather
[01:05.77]We're Apples to the-e core
[01:23.07]You're more fun than the colo-or pink
[01:26.12]Or balloons flying over your fav'ri-ite drink
[01:29.82]The love I feel here is swim not sink
[01:32.98]As we party across this land
[01:36.62]We're Apples forever, Apples together
[01:40.00]We're fam'ly but so much mo-ore
[01:43.48]No matter what comes, we will face the weather
