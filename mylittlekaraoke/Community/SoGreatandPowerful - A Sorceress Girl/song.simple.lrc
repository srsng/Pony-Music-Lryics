[00:04.86]Many a waltz spun awkwardly out of the rain
[00:10.48]She was an anxious refrain
[00:22.95]Takin' your time with the imperceptible
[00:28.06]Beautiful myths of becoming animal
[00:32.32]Wasp to orchid, orchid to the winter
[00:36.73]To regress is to move towards lesser difference
[00:41.09]Memories of a sorceress girl
[00:45.64]Endless fascination with the secrets of the world
[00:50.14]Dreams of the youth: those cute, little movements
[00:56.89]Darlin'
[00:59.00]Emit and combine particles-signs that transform
[01:05.65]A body into flame
[01:08.14]So tell me that this love is all we are~
[01:12.96]This simple story, this carousel we're on
[01:17.51]A little magic, a different kind of spark
[01:22.01]Our glassy essence just float~ing in the dark
[01:26.51]It's how you taught us to conjure up~
[01:31.11]A little kindness to take inside our hearts
[01:35.65]Our will to power
[01:37.34]Together, not apart
[01:40.15]Trace of the Other
[01:41.89](a tru~ly modern art)
[01:44.46]All that you are and all that you'll be
[01:48.36]Is harmony~
[01:52.90]Darlin' walk with me~, ah~
[01:58.34]A kind voice, a gentle face
[02:02.75]A friend who vanished without a trace
[02:06.40]A blue body
[02:08.70]An illusionist on stage~
[02:16.06]Twitcha-twitcha, can you stop a moment?
[02:20.65]What does Hegel mean by "Absolute Spirit"?
[02:25.29]So much love you are
[02:56.79]Memories of a sorceress girl
[03:01.34]Endless fascination with the secrets of the world
[03:05.89]Here we are starin' up
[03:08.09]Lookin' up at the same rainbow
