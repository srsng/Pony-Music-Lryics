[00:04.80]Many a waltz spun awkwardly out of the rain
[00:10.10]She was an anxious refrain
[00:22.57]Takin' your time with the imperceptible
[00:27.68]Beautiful myths of becoming animal
[00:31.94]Wasp to orchid, orchid to the winter
[00:36.35]To regress is to move towards lesser difference
[00:40.71]Memories of a sorceress girl
[00:45.25]Endless fascination with the secrets of the world
[00:49.75]Dreams of the youth: those cute, little movements
[00:56.55]Darlin'
[00:58.66]Emit and combine particles-signs that transform
[01:05.32]A body into flame
[01:07.80]So tell me that this love is all we are~
[01:12.63]This simple story, this carousel we're on
[01:17.17]A little magic, a different kind of spark
[01:21.67]Our glassy essence just float~ing in the dark
[01:26.17]It's how you taught us to conjure up~
[01:30.77]A little kindness to take inside our hearts
[01:35.22]Our will to power
[01:37.00]Together, not apart
[01:39.82]Trace of the Other
[01:41.55](a tru~ly modern art)
[01:44.13]All that you are and all that you'll be
[01:48.02]Is harmony~
[01:52.57]Darlin' walk with me~, ah~
[01:58.00]A kind voice, a gentle face
[02:02.41]A friend who vanished without a trace
[02:06.07]A blue body
[02:08.36]An illusionist on stage~
[02:15.72]Twitcha-twitcha, can you stop a moment?
[02:20.27]What does Hegel mean by "Absolute Spirit"?
[02:24.96]So much love you are
[02:56.46]Memories of a sorceress girl
[03:01.00]Endless fascination with the secrets of the world
[03:05.55]To harmony
[03:09.44]Darlin' walk with me~, ah~
