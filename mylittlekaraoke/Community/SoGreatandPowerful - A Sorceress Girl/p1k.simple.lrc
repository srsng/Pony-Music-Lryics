[00:02.42]Memories of a sorceress girl
[00:07.12]Endless fascination with the secrets of the world~
[00:26.42]Many a waltz spun awkwardly out of the rain
[00:32.37]She was an anxious refrain~
[00:40.82]Takin' your time with the imperceptible
[00:46.17]Beautiful myths of becoming animal~
[00:50.77]Wasp to orchid, orchid to the winter
[00:55.22]Regress is to move towards lesser difference
[01:00.02]Memories of a sorceress girl
[01:04.77]Endless fascination with the secrets of the world~
[01:09.67]Dreams of the youth: those cute, little movements~
[01:16.87]Darlin'
[01:18.92]Emit and combine particles signs that transform
[01:26.12]A body into flame
[01:28.57]So, tell me that this love is all we are~
[01:33.97]A simple story, this carousel we're on
[01:38.77]A little magic, a different kind of spark
[01:43.52]Our glassy essence just float~ing in the dark
[01:48.32]It's how you taught us to conjure up~
[01:53.12]A little kindness to take inside our hearts
[01:57.97]Our will to power
[01:59.72]Toge~ther, not apart
[02:02.72]Trace of the Other
[02:04.52](a tru~ly~ modern art)
[02:07.42]All that you are~ and
[02:09.72]All that you'll be is
[02:12.02]Harmony~
[02:16.12]You are so silly~
[02:21.32]Oh, a kind voice, a gentle face~
[02:26.72]A friend who vanished without a trace~
[02:30.62]A blue body, an illusionist on stage...
[02:40.12]Oh twitcha-twitcha, can you stop a moment?
[02:45.67]What does Hegel mean by "Absolute Spirit"?
[02:50.47]So much love you are!
[02:59.62]Oh this is the place for us
[03:03.27]The place for us
[03:05.12]The place we'd really love
[03:08.12]Or learn to love
[03:09.97]To join our separate lines
[03:12.52]To seize and multiply
[03:14.77]A dissasembly line extracting from you
[03:19.27]Comb your hair, smooth your dress
[03:22.82]Tidy up
[03:24.02]Smile for us
[03:28.87]Take a look, take a breath
[03:32.42]Giddy up
[03:33.67]Smile for us
[03:38.47]So much love you are
[03:47.72]So, tell me that this love is all we are~
[03:53.12]This simple story, this carousel we're on

[04:02.72]Our glassy essence just float~ing in the dark
[04:07.57]It's how you taught us to conjure up~
[04:12.37]A little kindness to take inside~ our hearts
[04:17.17]Our will to power
[04:18.92]Toge~ther, not apart
[04:21.97]Trace of the Other

[04:26.57]All that you are and
[04:28.82]All that you'll be is
[04:31.22]Harmony~
[04:35.37]Darlin' walk with me~, ah~

[05:07.77]Nothing's too hard
[05:09.32]With everyone's love, it's just love, it's every pony
[05:13.82]Every pony, every seed~
