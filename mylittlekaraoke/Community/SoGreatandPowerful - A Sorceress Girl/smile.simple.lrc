[00:04.57]Many a waltz spun awkwardly out of the rain
[00:10.25]She was an anxious refrain
[00:22.71]Takin' your time with the imperceptible
[00:27.78]Beautiful myths of becoming animal~
[00:32.04]Wasp to orchid, orchid to the winter
[00:36.40]To regress is to move towards lesser difference
[00:40.81]Memories of a sorceress girl
[00:45.40]Endless fascination with the secrets of the world
[00:49.86]Dreams of the youth: those cute, little movements

[02:16.25]This is the place for us
[02:18.87]The place for us
[02:20.70]Make this the place we love, or learn to love
[02:25.25]To join our separate lives
[02:27.45]To seize and multiply
[02:29.75]Unless disassembly line extracting from you!
[02:33.96]Calm your hair smooth your dress
[02:37.34]Tidy up
[02:38.46]Smile for us
[02:42.96]Clear your throat take a breath
[02:46.34]Giddy up!
[02:47.51]Smile for us
