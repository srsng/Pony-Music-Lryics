[01:22.32]I've seen enou~gh here, to know I don't belo~ng
[01:27.80]My imagina~tion, again has lead me o~n
[01:33.35]This stubborn a~ching, has a mi~nd of its own
[01:39.05]I've left, but I won't tell you where I've gone
[01:44.37]I've never kno~wn that, the world could be so~ mean
[01:49.92]I'll never go back, to who I used to be
[01:55.47]A steady ru~nway, is all that I would need
[02:01.10]To reason with myself behi~nd the scenes
[02:05.82]Is it me…
[02:07.17]Is it me, or can you see through my walls
[02:12.05]As if the~y'd ne~~ver shown?
[02:16.85]Could it be…
[02:18.20]Could it be, all because of my lies?
[02:23.07]I've broken my~~ own bones
[02:30.27]No more throwing stones
[02:42.35]I could have swo~rn I, I had a life before
[02:47.82]My short attention, had wanted something mo~re
[02:53.37]I can't erase it, I know I won't forget
[02:58.92]But at least I learned my lesson i~n the end
[03:05.07]Winter bree~zes, were never gone so fast
[03:09.87]It's straight ahead now, and no more looking ba~ck
[03:15.42]Like separa~tion, letting go~ of the past
[03:21.12]And trying to rebuild my hou~se of glass
[03:25.85]Is it me…
[03:27.20]Is it me, or can you see through my walls
[03:32.07]As if the~y'd ne~~ver shown?
[03:36.87]Could it be…
[03:38.22]Could it be, all because of my lies?
[03:43.10]I've broken my~~ own bones
[03:47.52]No more throwing stones
[03:49.25]Is it me, or can you see through my walls
[03:54.12]As if the~y'd ne~~ver shown?
[03:58.92]Could it be…
[04:00.27]Could it be, all because of my lies?
[04:05.15]I've broken my~~ own bones
[04:09.57]No more throwing stones
