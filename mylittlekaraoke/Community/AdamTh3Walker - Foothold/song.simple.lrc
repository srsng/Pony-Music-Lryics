[00:30.45]I've been watching you
[00:42.55]Giving up all of the things you had
[00:54.84]I was lo~st among the foothills too
[01:06.89]I fled higher to this precious la~nd
[01:17.18]Oooooh
[01:24.39]The air is rich and soil is fertile
[01:36.86]So give me your hand
[01:42.89]So give me your ha~~nd
[01:49.41]Even if you forget me in a moment's time
[01:59.66]You'll be fine
[02:13.26]For paradise you're moving slow
[02:16.38]Cross precipice
[02:18.01]And frozen snow
[02:19.33]Keep moving you ahead
[02:22.37]Keep moving
[02:25.99]Remember where you last saw yourself clearly
[02:28.89]Asking why you hated getting up early
[02:31.89]Don't be lead astray
[02:34.51]Keep moving your own way
[02:38.00]There's a love
[02:40.54]A sacrifice
[02:44.03]Haunted by this bad advice
[02:50.11]Given time the heart will wilt
[02:52.74]And heal itself with what it will
[02:56.27]Letters, songs, and bits of string
[02:59.22]Don't let any hatred in
[03:02.26]Always makin' references
[03:04.88]To passages in books you've read
[03:08.37]Reaching out in to the dark
[03:11.32]Settling for hope instead
[03:14.81]Only let go of the flat li~ne
[03:18.94]Only let go~ to find a foothold
[03:23.56]Old hori~zon
[03:26.60]Lazy weekends, crowded streets
[03:29.36]Behind the curtains you can see
[03:32.62]Taking all the time away
[03:35.71]You can't relate
[03:39.20]Only let go of the flat line
[03:43.23]Only let go to find a foothold
[03:47.81]Old hori~zon
[03:50.89]Lazy weekends, crowded streets
[03:53.79]Behind the curtains you can't see
[03:56.92]Taking all the time away
[04:00.00]You can't relate
[04:03.45]Only let go of the flat line
[04:07.62]Only let go to find a foothold
[04:12.11]Old hori~zon
[04:15.19]Lazy weekends, crowded streets
[04:18.00]Behind the curtains you can't see
[04:21.17]Taking all the time away
[04:24.30]You can't relate
[04:25.89]You can't relate
[04:27.38]You can't relate
[04:28.88]You can't relate
[04:30.37]You can't relate
[04:31.87]You can't relate
