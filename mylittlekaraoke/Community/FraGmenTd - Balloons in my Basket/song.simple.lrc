[01:00.66]I used to hide myself away
[01:05.11]From the cloudy skies of gray
[01:08.16]I didn't laugh I didn't know how
[01:12.89]But all that's behind me now
[01:15.66]No clouds today the sky is clear
[01:20.11]Just laugh to make them disappear
[01:22.85]I was going to bring cupcakes
[01:26.64]But I ate them all so-o
[01:30.85]I put balloons in my basket
[01:35.07]And watched them float away
[01:38.16]I hope that it fills you with laughter
[01:42.69]And sweeps your fears away
[01:45.89]I put balloons in my basket
[01:50.35]It usually gets a laugh or two
[01:53.12]It's much more fun when it's unexpected
[01:57.38]I threw this party just for you
[02:15.66]I know that I'm hard to understand
[02:19.88]Sometimes I don't even get myself
[02:23.16]But where's the fun thinking so-o hard?
[02:27.34]Let's just go roll on the ground
[02:29.56]The-ere's lots of other things that I'd rather do
[02:31.60] eating lots of sugary things with you
[02:33.47] Ice cream candy pie and chocolate rain
[02:35.42] ignore the crowd they just think we're insane
[02:37.26] run into the forest just to laugh at the trees
[02:39.09]then run back out while giggling at the ghostly
[02:41.13] there's Evil enchantress
[02:42.06] who does evil dances
[02:42.84] when you look deep in her eyes she puts you in the punch bowl
[02:47.73]I put balloons in my basket
[02:51.95]And watched them float away
[02:54.99]I hope that it fills you with laughter
[02:59.49]And sweeps your fears away
[03:02.73]I put balloons in my basket
[03:07.22]It usually gets a laugh or two
[03:09.99]It's much more fun when it's unexpected
[03:14.21]I threw this party just for you
[03:31.87]I-I may seem so very crazy
[03:35.58] When I say my tail makes the future less ha-azy
[03:39.09] but come along with me-e and I'm sure you'll find
[03:42.37] falling pianos won't get you when you're right behind me
[03:46.83] All it really takes is a cup of flour
[03:48.62] and suddenly you're going ninety miles an hour
[03:50.34] everypony thinks I'm annoying sometimes
[03:52.30]but they all agree my parties are really fun times
[03:54.41] Learning how to laugh at your flaws is part of the fun
[03:56.36] but I don't laugh at anyone
[03:57.88] I'm energetic sympathetic there when you need me
[03:59.72] silly ponies who don't listen get eaten by the parasprites
[04:02.10]Candy cakes and pies o-oh my-y
[04:03.47] where were you when I was kickin' it with Fluttergu-uy?
[04:05.34] with a twitchin' twitch twitch Twi fell into a ditch
[04:07.30] I got knocked into a bush with a bump from Flutterbitch
[04:09.48]I wouldn't trade my sense of humor
[04:11.08] for all the sugar in the world
[04:12.84] cause I'm the partyingest pony in town
[04:14.72] stick with me and I'll show you how to rock that frown
[04:16.83]Upside down
[04:19.64]I put balloons in my basket
[04:23.94]And watched them float away
[04:26.90]I hope that it fills you with laughter
[04:31.44]And sweeps your fears away
[04:34.56]I put balloons in my basket
[04:39.09]It usually gets a laugh or two
[04:41.90]It's much more fun when it's unexpected
[04:46.12]I threw this party just for you
