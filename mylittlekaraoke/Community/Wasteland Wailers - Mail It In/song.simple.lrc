[00:07.26]Stan~din' on my doorstep, waitin' for a package~
[00:11.03]Hopin' for that blissful moment when~
[00:13.90]That~ blonde-haired angel falls~ out of the heavens
[00:17.67]With a bag full of bills again
[00:20.95]It's a little bit awkward when~ she gives 'em over
[00:24.68]It's hard~ to look her in the~ eye~
[00:28.04]It~ might just be the way she's fumblin'
[00:31.93]Bringin' out my nervous side
[00:37.22]Some folks like to send telegrams~
[00:40.74]O~thers like to drop on~ in
[00:43.86]But~ if it means~ that I see that girl
[00:47.63]Well, I'm a-gonna mail it in~
[00:52.63]She's a star of civil service, the reason for insurance
[00:56.44]But I~ don't seem to get a~ break~
[00:59.72]My~ mailed pleas to her majesties come back
[01:03.69]"Just tell this girl for goodness sake"
[01:06.89]I'm~ up all night readin' catalogs~
[01:10.99]Placin' orders til I'm~ broke~
[01:13.81]'Cause~ when they arrive I hope~ I'll have the courage
[01:17.63]To get these words out of my throat~~
[01:23.12]Some can sing~ pretty songs of love~
[01:26.60]Some~ have handsome words~ and grins~
[01:29.76]But the on~ly way~ that I see that girl
[01:33.48]Is when I go and mail it in~
[01:52.79]It don't matter what the weather, she sure~ has it together
[01:56.43]Though she~ might lose a thing or~ two~
[01:59.71]Her~ smile that sparkles holds a beat up parcel~
[02:03.89]Half my stuff is taped or glued
[02:06.80]There's a crash on the porch, I open up the door
[02:10.69]Help~ her stand and fix her~ hat~
[02:13.85]My~ voice is misbehavin' time to spend what I've been savin'
[02:17.62]To buy a softer welcome mat
[02:21.27]You naughty boy
[02:23.11]Some folks like to send telegrams~
[02:26.68]O~thers like to drop on~ in~
[02:29.75]But~ all I want~ is to see that girl
[02:33.48]So, I'm a-gonna mail it in~~
[02:37.25]Some can sing~ pretty songs of love~
[02:40.73]Some~ have handsome words~ and grins~
[02:43.89]But the on~ly time~ that I see that girl~
[02:47.66]Is when~ I go and mail it in~
[02:50.98]Is when~ I go and mail it in~
