[00:16.71]I'll cook up a solution
[00:18.32]With the knowledge I've accrued
[00:20.40]They say a kitchen time saves nine,
[00:22.36]But I'm just saving two!
[00:24.14]I've gathered the ingredients
[00:25.96]To make some time sorbet
[00:27.89]There's hardly room for seconds
[00:29.44]When the seconds melt away!
[00:31.72]Watch as I work my gypsy magic
[00:33.59]Eye of a newt and cinnamon
[00:35.38]Watch as the matter turns to batter
[00:37.22]Open the portal, jump in!
[00:54.74]Crude stew, do you fear it Apple Bloom?
[00:57.97]Sometimes life is not a cake walk,
[00:59.87]Served up on a silver spoon
[01:02.12]Toss a fig and,
[01:03.96]Save the date and,
[01:05.92]Bread and butter, chant and mutter,
[01:07.71]Marination, incantation,
[01:09.55]Chocolate icing, timeline splicing,
[01:11.40]Yeast is rising, rectifying
[01:31.68]Pinkie if you're hearing this
[01:33.35]It means we're dead and gone
[01:35.37]Please don't bake a portal
[01:36.75]Just accept it and move on
[01:38.83]My cauldron is preheated
[01:40.56]And I've got you in my thrall
[01:42.55]Let's beat these yolks and save my folks
[01:44.42]By baking the fourth wall!
[01:46.41]Watch as I work my gypsy magic
[01:48.31]Seapony tears and provolone
[01:50.18]God help the outcast with her witchcraft
[01:52.03]Someday I'm gonna go home
[01:54.45]Someday, I'm gonna go home
[02:04.24]*Sigh*
