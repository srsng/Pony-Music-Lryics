[00:37.65][P2] It has been a thousand years
[00:41.23][P2] Since I have had someone
[00:45.67][P2] To hold me close and give me hope
[00:49.32][P2] But I fear those nights are gone
[00:53.76][P2] My subjects tend to fear me
[00:57.93][P2] Not see me as I am
[01:02.10][P2] I've tried so hard to be myself
[01:06.28][P2] But they don't understand
[01:10.97][P1] I have lived a thousand years
[01:14.63][P1] In loneliness and pain
[01:19.39][P1] Watching friends be born to die
[01:22.97][P1] While knowing I'll remain
[01:27.21][P1] I long to have another
[01:31.39][P1] In whom I can confide
[01:35.49][P1] My heart is far too heavy
[01:39.67][P1] From all my past goodbyes
[01:43.91][P2] But we know that one day we will overcome
[01:51.67][P2] For we know that we are capable of love
[01:53.56][P1] We are capable of love
[02:51.86][P2] Like the stars that shine into the night
[02:55.06][P2] I'll always dare~ to dream
[02:58.26][P1] Like the sun that shines above~ us
[03:01.06][P1] Things are brighter than~ they seem
[03:04.65][P1] There is no light without the dark
[03:04.65][P2] There is no light without the dark
[03:07.91][P1] No dark without~ the light~
[03:07.91][P2] No dark without~ the light~
[03:11.49][P1] Time cannot deny a day
[03:11.49][P2] Time cannot deny a day
[03:14.30][P1] Our hearts are free from strife
[03:14.30][P2] Our hearts are free from strife
[03:17.43][P1] We know that one day we will overcome
[03:23.69][P1] For we know that we are capable of love
[03:25.06][P2] We are capable of love
[03:37.13][P2] Times are always changing
[03:40.45][P2] And I know that I'm behind
[03:44.89][P1] My subjects know my power
[03:49.06][P1] But not my troubled mind
[03:53.23][P2] My romance is outdated
[03:57.41][P2] I'd just embarrass myself
[04:01.65][P1] They come to me with questions
[04:05.82][P1] Concerned with someone else
[04:09.93][P1] But still I find a hope in knowing
[04:09.93][P2] But still I find a hope in knowing
[04:14.63][P1] This is not the norm
[04:14.63][P2] This is not the norm
[04:18.86][P1] Life and love both come and go
[04:18.86][P2] Life and love both come and go
[04:22.45][P1] We battled through the storm
[04:22.45][P2] We battled through the storm
[04:26.63][P1] One day we'll dine on happiness
[04:26.63][P2] One day we'll dine on happiness
[04:30.86][P1] We share with those we love
[04:30.86][P2] We share with those we love
[04:34.97][P1] Our worries and our struggles
[04:34.97][P2] Our worries and our struggles
[04:39.15][P1] Will melt away because
[04:39.15][P2] Will melt away because
[04:43.65][P1] We know that one day we will overcome
[04:51.15][P1] For we know that we are capable of love
[04:53.04][P2] We are capable of love
[05:00.15][P1] We hope that out there someone's thinking of
[05:00.15][P2] We hope that out there someone's thinking of
[05:08.36][P1] The princesses that rule~ Equestria
[05:08.36][P2] The princesses that rule~ Equestria
