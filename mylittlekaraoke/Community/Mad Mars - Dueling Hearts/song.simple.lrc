[00:37.65]It has been a thousand years
[00:41.23]Since I have had someone
[00:45.67]To hold me close and give me hope
[00:49.32]But I fear those nights are gone
[00:53.76]My subjects tend to fear me
[00:57.93]Not see me as I am
[01:02.10]I've tried so hard to be myself
[01:06.28]But they don't understand
[01:10.97]I have lived a thousand years
[01:14.63]In loneliness and pain
[01:19.39]Watching friends be born to die
[01:22.97]While knowing I'll remain
[01:27.21]I long to have another
[01:31.39]In whom I can confide
[01:35.49]My heart is far too heavy
[01:39.67]From all my past goodbyes
[01:43.91]But we know that one day we will overcome
[01:51.67]For we know that we are capable of love
[02:51.86]Like the stars that shine into the night
[02:55.06]I'll always dare~ to dream
[02:58.26]Like the sun that shines above~ us
[03:01.06]Things are brighter than~ they seem
[03:04.65]There is no light without the dark
[03:07.91]No dark without~ the light~
[03:11.49]Time cannot deny a day
[03:14.30]Our hearts are free from strife
[03:17.43]We know that one day we will overcome
[03:23.69]For we know that we are capable of love
[03:37.13]Times are always changing
[03:40.45]And I know that I'm behind
[03:44.89]My subjects know my power
[03:49.06]But not my troubled mind
[03:53.23]My romance is outdated
[03:57.41]I'd just embarrass myself
[04:01.65]They come to me with questions
[04:05.82]Concerned with someone else
[04:09.93]But still I find a hope in knowing
[04:14.63]This is not the norm
[04:18.86]Life and love both come and go
[04:22.45]We battled through the storm
[04:26.63]One day we'll dine on happiness
[04:30.86]We share with those we love
[04:34.97]Our worries and our struggles
[04:39.15]Will melt away because
[04:43.65]We know that one day we will overcome
[04:51.15]For we know that we are capable of love
[05:00.15]We hope that out there someone's thinking of
[05:08.36]The princesses that rule~ Equestria
