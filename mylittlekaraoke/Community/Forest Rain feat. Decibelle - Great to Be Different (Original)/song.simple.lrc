[00:07.01]It was a da-ark da-ay
[00:09.06]When I lost my faith
[00:13.54]Wasn't the po-ony
[00:14.76]I thought I-I'd be
[00:19.67]And it seemed that
[00:21.14]No one could relate
[00:25.91]There was nothing left for me to-o see
[00:30.58]So I took a walk
[00:34.09]To the edge of the to-o-own
[00:38.13]And thought of leaving it all be-ehind
[00:43.00]When I
[00:44.56]Saw a little letter
[00:45.88]Fa-all right out of the-e sky-y-y
[00:50.79]As a grey mare hovered way u-up high
[00:56.83]I thought I was cra-azy-y
[00:58.88]When I saw her wave
[01:03.31]And then simply fly a-away
[01:09.49]So I opened the letter and looked inside
[01:15.68]And what was written made my-y day
[01:20.45]It said
[01:21.96]Isn't it great
[01:23.28]To-o be differe-e-ent?
[01:28.20]Isn't it wonderful
[01:29.95]To be exactly who you a-are?
[01:34.48]When you learn to sta-art
[01:36.52]Accepting yo-urse-e-elf
[01:40.61]You'll become a shining star
[01:59.41]To this day-y
[02:00.53]The writing on that pa-age
[02:05.45]Is mottled by the tears I-I shed
[02:11.68]Cuz at that moment something inside me changed
[02:18.06]And a bright new path I-I lead
[02:24.05]I ran back home
[02:25.47]And I picked up my old guita-a-a-ar
[02:30.58]And I started stru-umming the-ese chords
[02:35.60]And I sa-ang her words
[02:38.91]Along with thi-is so-o-ong
[02:43.05]And I heard someone sing a-along
[02:47.48]And we sang
[02:49.28]Isn't it great
[02:50.55]To-o be differe-e-ent?
[02:55.51]Isn't it wonderful
[02:57.27]To be exactly who you a-are?
[03:01.75]When you learn to sta-art
[03:03.74]Accepting yourse-e-elf
[03:07.93]You'll become a shini-ing sta-a-a-ar
[03:26.49]I turned around
[03:27.95]And I saw her at my door
[03:32.72]That cute grey mare
[03:33.99]With the wall-e-eyed stare
[03:38.95]She said, "I've heard you pla-ay and sing before
[03:44.90]And I heard a sadness I could no-ot bear
[03:51.18]I just wanted to tell you
[03:53.03]That the hardest thing I've fa-a-aced
[03:57.75]Wasn't the teasing or the-e pai-in
[04:02.67]It was convincing myself
[04:05.79]I wasn't stupid, strange, or la-a-ame
[04:10.07]And helping others do the-e sa-ame"
[04:44.36]These last few years
[04:45.87]Flew by just like a blur
[04:50.59]I'm now exactly where I sho-uld be
[04:57.07]And I kno-ow I o-owe it all to her
[05:03.06]That beautiful mare who believed i-in me
[05:09.54]Isn't it great
[05:10.85]To-o be differe-e-ent?
[05:15.72]Isn't it wonderful
[05:17.47]To be exactly who you a-are?
[05:21.95]When you learn to sta-art
[05:23.95]Accepting yourse-e-elf
[05:28.24]You'll become a shini-ing star
[05:34.47]Isn't it great
[05:35.78]To-o be differe-e-ent?
[05:40.70]Isn't it wonderful
[05:42.46]To be exactly who you a-are?
[05:46.94]When you learn to sta-art
[05:48.89]Accepting yourse-e-elf
[05:53.32]You'll become a shini-ing star
[05:59.75]You'll become a shini-ing star
[06:06.42]When you learn to-o love
[06:08.56]Just who you a-a-are
