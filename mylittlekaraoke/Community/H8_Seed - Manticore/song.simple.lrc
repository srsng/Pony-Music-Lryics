[00:26.53]The clouds rolling overhead block out all the light
[00:29.20]The twisting trees and branches are an ominous sight
[00:31.86]You know that something's watching, hear a howl in the night
[00:34.36]And beneath your calm exterior, you tremble with fright
[00:37.19]Your legs begin to sha-ake and your tail starts to sway
[00:39.53]You feel its hunger for you as you try to hide your dismay
[00:42.53]You think you might be able to keep the beast at bay
[00:45.19]But heed your better judgment, you know it's unwise to stay
[00:49.03]SO YOU BETTER RUN AWAY
[00:55.02]THE MANTICORE
[01:05.69]THE MANTICORE
[01:11.85]A mighty bellow signals that the hunt has commenced
[01:14.52]You start to hoof it, bending to your own common sense
[01:17.19]You know no one's around to help you mount a defense
[01:19.85]And as you run, the air you're breathing starts to get dense
[01:22.52]You try not to stumble, legs aquiver with fear
[01:25.19]And all its vicious snarling's like a gun in your ear
[01:27.85]Adrenaline numbs your body as it kicks into gear
[01:30.52]You see your peaceful village and you finally think you're clear
[01:34.35]BUT YOUR DOOM DRAWS EVER NEAR
[01:36.68]Run from the manticore!
[01:38.52]It senses your fear
[01:39.85]So there's nowhere to hide, now
[01:41.68]It's a creature like no other before
[01:43.52]A feral killing machine
[01:45.18]So you should stay inside, now
[01:46.68]Cower before the manticore
[01:49.01]Under cover of night
[01:50.35]It'll beat you til you're black and blue
[01:52.35]A terrifying carnivore
[01:54.51]You better watch your back because
[01:55.85]It's gonna make a filly out of you!
[02:01.68]THE MANTICORE
[02:51.67]BUT YOUR DOOM DRAWS EVER-
[02:53.21]You loose a cry for he-elp as you duck into town
[02:55.88]You feel the massive tremors when its paws hit the ground
[02:58.54]Your fellow ponies wake from the cacophonous sound
[03:01.21]But no one tries to save you from the monster inbound
[03:04.04]You collapse, exhausted from your perilous hike
[03:06.54]The realization hits you that your head's on a pike
[03:09.21]You bow before the manticore with tears in your eyes
[03:11.87]You close your eyes in horror as you wait for its blow to strike
[03:15.54]IT'S GONNA END YOUR LIFE TONIGHT
[03:18.04]Run from the manticore!
[03:19.87]It senses your fear
[03:21.20]So there's nowhere to hide, now
[03:23.04]It's a creature like no other before
[03:24.87]A feral killing machine
[03:26.54]So you should stay inside, now
[03:28.04]Cower before the manticore
[03:30.37]Under cover of night
[03:31.70]It'll beat you til you're black and blue
[03:33.70]A terrifying carnivore
[03:35.87]You better watch your back because
[03:37.20]It's gonna make a filly out of you!
[03:43.03]THE MANTICORE
[03:53.70]THE MANTICORE
[03:57.20]You better watch your back because
[03:58.53]It's gonna make a filly out of you!
