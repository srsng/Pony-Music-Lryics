For I oh so love the groom
All my thoughts he does consume
Oh, Shining Aarmor
I'll be there very soon
I have never seen a pony quite like you
What they don't know is that she's a changeling
She's got a parasitic style and unfeeling intentions
Mi Amore Cadenza
This is all my fault
Whatever are you talking about?
What wouldn't Twilight want me to know anything about?
Wewewell there's a new regime now
For I oh so love the groom
All my thoughts he does consume
Oh, Shining Aarmor
I'll be there very soon
For I oh so love the groom
All my thoughts he does consume
Oh, Shining Aarmor
I'll be there very soon
Cadance had the ideal life
Gave her all to her knight
You broke her and let the pieces fall
And so you staged the perfect crime
You ruin everyone you mimic
This day is going to be perfect
This is all my fault
Whatever are you talking about?
What wouldn't Twilight want me to know anything about?
Wewewell there's a new regime now
For I oh so love the groom
All my thoughts he does consume
Oh, Shining Aarmor
I'll be there very soon
And you can't feel the pain you bring
Heartless changeling
Cause you're not a part of this affair
But Twilight is the brightest bulb
That's her brother that you hold
She won't go down without a fight
Wewewell there's a new regime now
For I oh so love the groom
All my thoughts he does consume
Oh, Shining Aarmor
I'll be there very soon
I'll be there very soon
