[00:06.50]A falling star fell from your heart
[00:12.88]and landed in my eyes
[00:20.25]I screamed aloud, as it tore through them,
[00:26.62]and now it's left me blind
[00:33.88]The stars, the moon,
[00:37.62]they have all been blown out
[00:40.38]You left me in the dark
[00:47.62]No dawn, no day,
[00:51.12]I'm always in this twilight
[00:54.25]In the shadow of your heart
[01:01.38]And in the dark,
[01:05.00]I can hear your heartbeat
[01:07.75]I tried to find the sound
[01:15.12]But then it stopped,
[01:18.50]and I was in the darkness,
[01:21.50]So darkness I be ca~~~~me
[01:28.75]The stars, the moo~n,
[01:32.50]they have all been blown out
[01:35.25]You left me in the dark
[01:42.50]No dawn, no day,
[01:45.88]I'm always in this twilight
[01:50.00]In the shadow of your heart
[01:56.62]uoh~ uoh~
[02:00.12]uo~o~oh~
[02:03.50]uoh~
[02:05.25]uo~ooh~
[02:10.00]I took the stars from my eyes
[02:12.62]and then I made a map
[02:16.25]And knew that somehow
[02:19.38]I could find my way back
[02:23.25]Then I heard your heart beating,
[02:26.62]you were in the darkness too
[02:30.12]So I stayed in the darkness with you
[02:38.50]The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
[02:44.88]You left me in the daaaaark~
[02:52.25]No dawn, no day,
[02:55.75]I'm always in this twilight
[02:59.00]In the shadow of your heaaaart~
[03:06.00]The stars, the moo~n, they have all been blown out
[03:12.50]You left me in the dark
[03:19.75]No dawn, no day,
[03:23.00]I'm always in this twilight
[03:27.25]In the shadow of your heart~
[03:33.88]uoh~
