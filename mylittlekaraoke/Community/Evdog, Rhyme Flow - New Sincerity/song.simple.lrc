[00:35.10]Look
[00:35.57]You've been a sarcastic
[00:36.94]Sharp spastic
[00:37.95]Smart-ass jerk for so long you've turned plastic
[00:40.61]Now let me tell you there's another way to think of things
[00:43.07]Instead of jaded and bitter the way you've hated things
[00:45.61]This bile venomous enemy that you've had to be
[00:48.11]It doesn't have to be this way
[00:49.36]Because it's sad to see
[00:50.77]There's a movement
[00:51.55]Dude's getting attuned to the root of emotions
[00:53.77]Saying the truth as improvement
[00:56.16]I mean sincere from the heart's core
[00:58.07]I mean bereft of the fear, and clearly far more
[01:00.57]Say what you mean and truly mean what you say
[01:02.76]They're honest with their words
[01:03.77]And there's earnesty in their praise
[01:05.73]Yeah, so raise 'em up for this way of thought
[01:08.11]To wear your hearts on your sleeves is just saying a lot
[01:10.57]And I ain't playing, 'cause Rhyme Flow is saving a spot
[01:13.11]The New Sincerity plan that I'm aiming to rock
[01:15.85]The world that we can see
[01:17.68]It shows no authenticity
[01:20.14]We want transparency
[01:22.76]Without the snidey irony
[01:25.10]No shallow vanity
[01:27.76]We value our humanity, yeah
[01:31.04]Let us set it free
[01:32.68]A kind of New Sincerity
[01:35.61]Get in your head and don't bet on the bad
[01:37.29]Abandon the fad
[01:38.27]Embed in your mind
[01:39.13]Prepare to be glad
[01:40.10]I was jaded as the next man, just glaringly mad
[01:42.60]I carried the past on my shoulders
[01:44.17]Despairingly sad
[01:45.14]But
[01:45.61]I found I felt the fear falling away
[01:47.33]I'll call it decay
[01:48.23]Appallingly lost
[01:49.17]Not sorry to say
[01:50.14]This sincerity apparent in me
[01:51.82]This caring in me
[01:52.76]Just staring at me right in the face
[01:54.32]Just daring to be
[01:55.22]So
[01:55.92]I let it go
[01:56.78]I let it fly
[01:57.80]I let the truth from the soul I was holdin' inside
[02:00.02]And I can tell you it's a blessing and a gift
[02:02.17]Because the weight pressing on my heart
[02:03.81]It started to lift
[02:04.79]And started to drift
[02:05.73]This anger I wore
[02:06.74]It started to rip
[02:07.60]And beneath spoke a genuine part of the script
[02:09.95]It said:
[02:10.61]"Be true to yourself, be honest and kind
[02:12.49]This new sincerity inherently is brought in the mind"
[02:15.10]Yeah
[02:15.85]The world that we can see
[02:17.68]It shows no authenticity
[02:20.14]We want transparency
[02:22.72]Without the snidey irony
[02:25.06]No shallow vanity
[02:27.76]We value our humanity, yeah
[02:31.04]Let us set it free
[02:32.72]A kind of New Sincerity, yo
[02:35.96]The world that we can see
[02:37.72]It shows no authenticity
[02:40.10]We want transparency
[02:42.76]Without the snidey irony
[02:45.10]No shallow vanity
[02:47.72]We value our humanity, yeah
[02:51.00]Let us set it free
[02:52.76]A kind of New Sincerity
