And if anyone dare question~
To try our skills in a battle or two~
I've got you right in my sights~
Just magic against magic
Or prove your talent
You'll meet your maker tonight~
Oh I know~ you'll have to fold your cards 'cause
I've got the better hand~~
So given the circumstance
Oh~ oh~~ yeah~~
You've ruled this town~
A one trick pony for far too long
Let's question what's fair~
Just to rule it with common sense
Oh you're not even worthy
Don't get me started on the imperfections you've played~
From the moment I first met you~
It wasn't competition, on~ly a question
Of whether or not you would find the courage
To finally stand up and fight~
It's just magic against ma~gic or prove you're ta~lented
I'm gonna beat ya tonight~
And I know you'll have to fold your cards 'cause
I've got the better hand~~
So given the circumstance
You've got no chance~
You'd better move on
Yeah you'd better skip town
You'll be back next time~
To fight this grudge~ inside~~ oh
There's no respect in losing a fight~
Only shame that's hard to bite~
Like magic against magic it seems to clash and yet
Oh~ given the circumstance~~
Oh~ given the circumstance~~
You've got no chance~~
Ah pa pa
Ah pa da pa pa
Ah pa pa da da
Pa pa pa da da da da
Given the circumstance~
You've got no chance~~~~
