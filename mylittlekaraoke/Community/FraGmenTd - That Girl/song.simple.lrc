[00:38.57]Chilly weather rolling in?~
[00:42.86]Is it win~ter already?
[00:45.86]Can't be that time~ again~
[00:49.71]Rush to my window~
[00:51.86]White fluffy snow is on~ the ground~
[00:56.36]I'm gonna be late again
[00:58.71]Throw on my scarf and grab~ my plow
[01:03.43]I rush out to the field~
[01:06.43]Everypony else is there
[01:10.28]I just try to get started
[01:13.50]Hoping they all won't stare
[01:16.93]Just starting to get my~ rhythm
[01:20.14]Ignoring the cold in my feet _
[01:23.57]Till this purple pony girl~
[01:26.57]Blows on past the snow buries~ me
[01:30.00]Who is that~ girl?
[01:34.07]Why~ do I feel so~ strange?~
[01:37.50]It just took one glance~
[01:40.71]My mind is already blank
[01:43.71]I know this~ feeling
[01:47.57]But I know that it can't~ be~
[01:51.21]Will somepony slap me So
[01:54.21]I know it's not a dream
[02:24.85]Winter's done~
[02:27.85]We wrapped it up on time this year~
[02:32.35]But I can't get her out of my head
[02:35.57]My heart is choked up with fear~
[02:39.42]Went to her house and~
[02:41.57]I left some flowers at the door
[02:46.07]Why couldn't I stick around?
[02:48.42]Instead I bolted like a dork!
[02:53.14]What the hell is my problem?
[02:56.14]I haven't got a clue~
[02:59.78]She probably won't even notice
[03:02.99]But what else can I do?
[03:06.58]I look up to the~ sky
[03:09.85]And see her face in the clouds~
[03:13.60]Suddenly I hear her voice
[03:16.28]And my gaze is drawn back down
[03:19.71]Who is that~ girl?
[03:23.78]Why~ do I feel so~ strange?~
[03:27.21]It just took one glance~
[03:30.42]My mind is already blank
[03:33.42]I know this~ feeling
[03:37.28]But I know that it can't~ be~
[03:40.92]Will somepony slap me
[03:43.49]So I know it's not a dream
[04:13.49]She's standing there she looks at me
[04:15.21]She smiles oh so very sweetly
[04:17.13]Says she saw me leave the flowers
[04:18.85]I can't breathe - I want to cower
[04:20.56]Tilts her head asks "what's your name?"
[04:22.28]Words won't come faint sting of pain
[04:23.99]As the lump stops in my throat admiring her lovely coat
[04:27.21]My feet go numb I'm feeling dumb
[04:28.92]My body says it wants to run
[04:30.63]But everything inside my head
[04:32.35]is telling me to hold it steady
[04:34.28]Finally the nerve is there doubt starts to fade no longer bare
[04:37.49]And now at last open my mouth and... <gasp>
[04:48.85]Who is that~ girl?
[04:52.92]Why~ do I feel so~ strange?~
[04:56.35]It just took one glance~
[04:59.56]My mind is already blank
[05:02.56]I know this~ feeling
[05:06.63]But could it really~ be?~
[05:10.06]There's no need to slap me
[05:12.63]Cause now I know it's not a dream
[05:19.70]Now I know it's not a dream
[05:26.56]Now I know it's not a dream
