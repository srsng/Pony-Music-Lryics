[00:27.00]Evil breaks all seals
[00:29.55]And little fillies are scared
[00:34.46]When the moon hides in clouds
[00:36.90]And souls are filled with doubts
[00:39.45]Only we'll be prepared
[00:42.85]We live to serve and to defend
[00:45.33]And we will stand until the end
[00:48.50]No matter how it could be hard
[00:52.79]And through the darkness we will fight
[00:55.38]For our Princess of the Night
