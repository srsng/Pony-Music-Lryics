[00:21.94]Bright skies, don't let worries in your heart
[00:25.58]Or any seeds of doubt in your mind
[00:28.07]Have no fear you'll fall apa-art
[00:31.03]Because it's gonna be fine
[00:32.87]Life is for reaching for the sta-ars
[00:36.51]You never know what it wi-ill
[00:38.44]Bring to-o you
[00:41.48]Or what you can do
[00:42.90]When you're flying up there
[00:44.70]In the sky, rising high
[00:47.48]Every hue, it's like a dream
[00:49.88]Out of this world, into a new
[00:52.88]When you're soaring up there in the sky
[00:55.63]Spread your wings, and you'll see
[00:58.07]The cirrus swirl shimmering down be-elow
[01:02.70]And you'll recognize the glo-ow
[01:04.76]From a Double Rainboom
[01:10.46]A Double Rainboom
[01:16.76]Gliding, up above the rain and clouds
[01:20.23]Never feel the need to concede
[01:22.97]Fly above all of the crowds
[01:25.88]You know, we're gonna get through this
[01:27.73]Heart beats, as you climb and gather speed
[01:31.03]You know your friends are why-y-y the ra-inbo-o-ow glo-ow
[01:35.66]Will alwa-ays show
[01:37.71]When you're flying up there
[01:39.60]In the sky, rising high
[01:42.34]Every hue, it's like a dream
[01:44.87]Out of this world, into a new
[01:47.83]When you're soaring up there in the sky
[01:50.53]Spread your wings, and you will see
[01:52.88]A whole new wo-orld, shimmering do-o-own below
[01:57.51]And off yo-u go for a Double Rainboom
