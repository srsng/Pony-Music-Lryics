[00:14.62]It's getting hard to write
[00:20.94]And late into the night
[00:26.67]It's been a whi-le now
[00:29.83]I toss the mail around
[00:33.78]I hope you've been al~right
[00:40.10]I'm eager just to know
[00:46.13]Where from this point I~ go
[00:51.95]'Cause I can tell you now
[00:55.06]I've made my way around
[00:58.82]But I never seem to grow
[01:04.30]If you can see right through this let~ter
[01:10.72]Then all the tears are clearly shown
[01:16.94]I guess it must be for the bet~ter
[01:23.51]But I just thought I'd let you know~
[01:43.06]My ink is running out
[01:49.33]As midnight comes around
[01:55.06]I guess I'll close it up
[01:58.22]I think I've said enough
[02:01.38]'Cause I'm just waiting for you now
[02:07.50]If you can see right through this let~ter
[02:13.82]Then all the tears are clearly shown
[02:20.14]I guess it must be for the bet~ter
[02:26.66]But I just thought I'd let you know~
[02:32.74]If you can see right through this let~ter
[02:39.11]Then all the tears are clearly shown
[02:45.38]And still I know you'll never ans~wer
[02:51.89]But I just thought I'd let you know~
