[01:14.12]The clouds~ reflecting the light
[01:19.38]Of streetlamps staining the night~
[01:24.55]Your stars~ hidden away
[01:29.81]No dif'rence between night~ and day~
[01:35.32]Lu~na you left me
[01:40.17]Abandoned in the blazing light
[01:45.75]Luna why won't you show yourself to me?
[01:50.68]I need~ your comfort tonight~
[01:55.86]A time~ a time I recall~
[02:01.12]Your smile of silver that was all~
