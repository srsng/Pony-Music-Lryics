[00:15.95]I watched them change before my eyes
[00:19.66]Destinies rearranged to my surpri~se
[00:23.61]I tried so hard to make amends
[00:27.15]But my mistake has separated my fri~ends
[00:31.22]White turned to blu~ue, and blue to white
[00:35.05]Harmony rewritten ou~t of si~ght
[00:39.00]What can I do to bring you back?
[00:42.54]My technicolor world has faded to bla~ck
[00:47.15]Wake up now and see the truth
[00:50.68]I'm here to show the world to you
[00:54.81]The way it was meant to be
[00:58.58]So follow your destiny
[01:02.12]This twisted future isn't right
[01:06.01]Let's bring the real you to the light
[01:09.96]I'm going to make you realize
[01:14.45]So open your eyes
[01:32.72]I've made mistakes and failed before
[01:36.49]But somehow this time it's something mo~re
[01:40.38]Broken your life and who you are
[01:44.21]I'm afraid I've left a terrible scar~
[01:48.04]But apologi~es won't save me now
[01:51.64]It's up to me to restore you someho~w
[01:55.71]I'll bring you back your memories
[01:59.54]Piece by piece restoring harmony~
[02:03.85]Wake up now and see the truth
[02:07.45]I'm here to show the world to you
[02:11.64]The way it was meant to be

[02:26.73]I'm going to make you realize
[02:31.22]So open your eyes
[03:04.93]I've got to find a way
[03:08.70]To make this all oka~~y
[03:12.48]I've got to find a way
[03:16.31]To fix my own mista~~ke
[03:19.72]Oh, but I promise to succeed
[03:22.42]I know you're still in need
[03:24.33]I know you've been misused
[03:25.95]And you're probably confused
[03:27.98]But there's not much I can do
[03:30.08]The cure is within you
[03:32.06]So hold on tight
[03:33.91]And open your e~~yes

[03:58.94]I'm going to make you realize
[04:03.43]So open your e~yes
[04:22.06]Wake up now and see the truth
