[00:46.17]Her rainbow mane passes by
[00:51.58]She spreads her wings, and takes to the~ sky
[00:56.96]Loyal to you, you know that she'll~ try~
[01:02.37]She'll be your friend, there's no need to~ cry
[01:08.04]And I will spread my~ wings
[01:18.79]And you will fly with~ me
[01:29.29]Don't worry, I'll be fine
[01:32.00]Just as long, as there's time
[01:34.75]For~ you, to~ see
[01:40.17]You and me, we will fly
[01:42.83]Spread our wings, take to the sky~
[02:12.50]Her coat is blue as the sky
[02:17.83]It's just a blur, as she rockets~ by
[02:23.25]She'll take me up, she'll carry me~ high
[02:28.71]Into the clouds, I know that she'll~ be mine
[02:34.37]And I will spread my~ wings
[02:45.17]And you will fly with~ me
[02:55.62]Don't worry, I'll be fine,
[02:58.33]Just as long, as there's time
[03:01.00]For~ you, to~ see
[03:06.42]You and me, we will fly
[03:09.08]Spread our wings, take to the sky~
