I think it's time
To reconsider
Everything I've done~~~
I'm going now
If I've lost so much then
Maybe I can start again
'Cause if you brave the night
Alone~~~~
You'll come back alive
And find your way back home
'Cause when the light goes out~
You know it's not the end~
So darling just hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on~~
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on~~
Hold on
'Cause if you brave the night
Alone~~~~
You'll come back alive
And find your way back home
'Cause when the light goes out~
You know it's not the end~
So darling just hold on
Hold on
