[00:49.90]My return is a mystery
[00:52.05]Thought you had control of me
[00:54.43]I'm offended that you're so surprised
[00:57.29]That first defeat was a practice round
[00:59.62]But I pulled myself off the gro-ound
[01:02.06]And I've already planned your demise
[01:04.45]I won't stop fighting cause I'm not done yet
[01:07.79]You're gonna regret
[01:09.69]This time I won't let you forget
[01:12.56]You're not gonna get away this ti-ime
[01:15.48]I'll strike when you're blind
[01:17.32]You'll awake just to find you are mine
[01:20.19]You thought you won
[01:21.38]Thought the battle was over
[01:23.52]But I, I, I, I’m just getting stronger
[01:27.82]Enjoy your freedom
[01:29.07]It won't last much longer
[01:31.16]Cause I, I, I, I keep getting stronger
[01:35.69]When the sky turns to gre-ey
[01:37.59]When the light fades awa-ay
[01:39.50]You will say I just keep getting stronger
[01:43.32]You can try to prepa-are
[01:45.23]Or attack if you da-are
[01:47.13]I don't care, cause I'm just getting stronge-e-er
[01:54.29]I, I, I, I’m just getting stronger
[02:01.92]I, I, I, I’m just getting stronge-e-er
[02:09.31]Cause I, I, I, I’m just getting stronger
[02:17.18]I, I, I, I’m just getting stronger
[02:28.87]I am the nightmare that replays in your head
[02:32.68]I am the shadow lurking under your bed
[02:36.50]And when I lose it's never really the end
[02:40.31]You should have known I'd have a plan for revenge
[02:43.41]And I won't stop fighting cause I'm not done yet
[02:46.99]You're gonna regret
[02:48.90]This time I won't let you forget
