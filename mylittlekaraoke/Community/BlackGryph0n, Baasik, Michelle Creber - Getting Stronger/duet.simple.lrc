[00:49.90][P2] My return is a mystery
[00:52.05][P2] Thought you had control of me
[00:54.43][P2] I'm offended that you're so surprised
[00:57.29][P2] That first defeat was a practice round
[00:59.62][P2] But I pulled myself off the gro-ound

[01:39.50][P2] You will say I just keep getting stronger
[01:40.46][P1]  I just keep getting stronger
