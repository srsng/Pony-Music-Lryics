[00:43.29]I find myself alone and I'm happy
[00:47.22]Flying on my broken wings
[00:50.23]Hiding in my broken dreams
[00:53.19]Far away from everything
[00:55.88]When the starlight brings the night in
[00:59.12]Flying on my broken wings
[01:02.08]Soaring on the open sea
[01:05.05]No one here to bother me
[01:07.08]Falling asleep to the sweetest melody
[01:10.00]Dreams of my friends but, they're all leaving me
[01:14.31]I'm as happy as can be
[01:18.89]Ill-minded ways that I've fallen in again
[01:21.85]Taken apart but, I'm not giving in
[01:26.53]This isn't who I am
[01:30.74]Empty thoughts, words unsaid
[01:33.89]I can't get the voices out of my head
[01:38.89]They're here to stay
[01:42.55]Keeping sane, there's no~ means
[01:45.93]My entire life has come apart at the seams
[01:50.79]There's no escape
[01:54.44]I find myself alone and I'm happy
[01:58.38]Flying on my broken wings
[02:01.30]Hiding in my broken dreams
[02:04.31]Far away from everything
[02:06.99]When the starlight brings the night in
[02:10.19]Flying on my broken wings
[02:13.15]Soaring on the open sea
[02:16.16]No one here to bother me
[02:18.15]I find myself alone and I'm happy
[02:22.04]Flying on my broken wings
[02:25.05]Hiding in my broken dreams
[02:28.01]Far away from everything
[02:30.69]When the starlight brings the night in
[02:33.98]Flying on my broken wings
[02:36.85]Soaring on the open sea
[02:39.91]No one here to bother me
[02:41.90]Maybe I've changed, but I'll never be the same
[02:44.81]These wretched thoughts have only caused me pain
[02:49.49]I wish I could explain
[02:53.70]I've left my soul in the shadow of my past
[02:56.71]Remaining hopeful and never looking back
[03:01.48]How long can this last
[03:05.56]Empty thoughts, words unsaid
[03:08.75]I can't get the voices out of my head
[03:13.70]They're here to stay
[03:17.41]Keeping sane, there's no~ means
[03:20.74]My entire life has come apart at the seams
[03:25.46]There's no escape
[03:42.59]I find myself alone and I'm happy
[03:46.48]Flying on my broken wings
[03:49.44]Hiding in my broken dreams
[03:52.41]Far away from everything
[03:55.19]When the starlight brings the night in
[03:58.38]Flying on my broken wings
[04:01.20]Soaring on the open sea
[04:04.35]No one here to bother me
[04:06.30]I find myself alone and I'm happy
[04:10.14]Flying on my broken wings
[04:13.15]Hiding in my broken dreams
[04:16.11]Far away from everything
[04:18.84]When the starlight brings the night in
[04:22.13]Flying on my broken wings
[04:25.05]Soaring on the open sea
[04:27.96]No one here to bother me
[04:30.00]I find myself alone but I'm empty
[04:33.94]Falling with my broken wings
[04:36.85]Losing everything between
[04:39.86]Consequences unforeseen
[04:42.55]When the sunrise comes to greet me
[04:45.74]I'll stop to mend my broken wings
[04:48.70]Sunlight bathing everything
[04:51.67]Breathes the life back into me~
