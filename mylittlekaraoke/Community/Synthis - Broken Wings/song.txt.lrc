I find myself alone and I'm happy
Flying on my broken wings
Hiding in my broken dreams
Far away from everything
When the starlight brings the night in
Flying on my broken wings
Soaring on the open sea
No one here to bother me
Falling asleep to the sweetest melody
Dreams of my friends but, they're all leaving me
I'm as happy as can be
Ill-minded ways that I've fallen in again
Taken apart but, I'm not giving in
This isn't who I am
Empty thoughts, words unsaid
I can't get the voices out of my head
They're here to stay
Keeping sane, there's no~ means
My entire life has come apart at the seams
There's no escape
I find myself alone and I'm happy
Flying on my broken wings
Hiding in my broken dreams
Far away from everything
When the starlight brings the night in
Flying on my broken wings
Soaring on the open sea
No one here to bother me
I find myself alone and I'm happy
Flying on my broken wings
Hiding in my broken dreams
Far away from everything
When the starlight brings the night in
Flying on my broken wings
Soaring on the open sea
No one here to bother me
Maybe I've changed, but I'll never be the same
These wretched thoughts have only caused me pain
I wish I could explain
I've left my soul in the shadow of my past
Remaining hopeful and never looking back
How long can this last
Empty thoughts, words unsaid
I can't get the voices out of my head
They're here to stay
Keeping sane, there's no~ means
My entire life has come apart at the seams
There's no escape
I find myself alone and I'm happy
Flying on my broken wings
Hiding in my broken dreams
Far away from everything
When the starlight brings the night in
Flying on my broken wings
Soaring on the open sea
No one here to bother me
I find myself alone and I'm happy
Flying on my broken wings
Hiding in my broken dreams
Far away from everything
When the starlight brings the night in
Flying on my broken wings
Soaring on the open sea
No one here to bother me
I find myself alone but I'm empty
Falling with my broken wings
Losing everything between
Consequences unforeseen
When the sunrise comes to greet me
I'll stop to mend my broken wings
Sunlight bathing everything
Breathes the life back into me~
