There's no way to say this song's
About someone else
Every time you're not in my arms
I start to lose myself
Someone please pass me my shades
Don't let 'em see me down
You have taken over my days,
So tonight I'm going out
Yet I'm feeling like,
There is no better place
Than right by your side
I had a little taste,
And I'll only spoil
The party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind
La da dee, La da dee doo
La da da me, La da da you
La da dee, La da dee doo
There's only me, There's only you
La da dee, La da dee doo
La da da me, La da da you
La da dee, La da dee doo
When you were gone I think of you
All these places packed with people
But your face is all I see
And the music's way too loud
But your voice won't let me be
So many pretty girls around,
They're just dressing to impress
But the thought of you alone has got me
Spun and I don't know what to say next
Feeling like
There is no better place
Than right by your side
I had a little taste,
And I'll only spoil
The party anyway
'Cause all the girls are looking fine
But you're the only one on my mind
La da dee, La da dee doo
La da da me, La da da you
La da dee, La da dee doo
There's only me, There's only you
La da dee, La da dee doo
La da da me, La da da you
La da dee, La da dee doo
When you were gone I think of you
La da dee, La da dee doo
La da da me, La da da you
La da dee, La da dee doo
There's only me, There's only you
La da dee, La da dee doo
La da da me, La da da you
La da dee, La da dee doo
When you were gone I think of you
I pretend the night is so beautiful
Take a photo with the bros
La da dee, La da da doo
They won't see through my disguise
Right here behind my eyes,
Replaying in my mind
La de da
La da dee, La da dee doo
La da da me, La da da you
La da dee, La da dee doo
There's only me, There's only you
La da dee, La da dee doo
La da da me, La da da you
La da dee, La da dee doo
When you were gone I think of you
La da dee, La da dee doo
La da da me, La da da you
La da dee, La da dee doo
There's only me, There's only you
La da dee, La da dee doo
La da da me, La da da you
La da dee, La da dee doo
When you were gone I think of you.
