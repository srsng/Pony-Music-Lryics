She's got a way of knowing
What's on your mind
She really can't explain it
So she leaves you blind
Do you ever wonder why she
Always makes you smile?
If it's impossible physically
It suits her style
It keeps you smilin' for a while
She's made of giggles and gumdrops
Oven mitts and outtakes
Doodles and donuts
Fairytales and fruitcake
Ask her yourself but you'll never
Ever understand why
It's anything but a lie
Sometimes I tend to wonder
How she lived before
How could one survive so somber
Maybe there's more
It feels like every morning
She's wound up tight
She may be hard to talk to
But she's never shy
You can never ever look her in the eye
She's made of giggles and gumdrops
Oven mitts and outtakes
Doodles and donuts
Fairytales and fruitcake
Ask her yourself but you'll never
Ever understand why
She's made of chaos and cupcakes
Lots and lots of batter
Sugar and sunshine
Lollipops and laughter
See for yourself but you'll never get it
Don't even try
It's anything but a lie
Slow motion, so foreign
To somebody so hyperactively involved
Commotion, confusion
Talk of the town, she's a mystery
We'll never solve
We'll never solve
She's made of chaos and cupcakes
Lots and lots of batter
Sugar and sunshine
Lollipops and laughter
See for yourself but you'll never get it
Don't even try
Giggles and gumdrops
Oven mitts and outtakes
Doodles and donuts
Fairytales and fruitcake
Ask her yourself but you'll never
Ever understand why
No you'll never ever understand why
It's anything but a lie
