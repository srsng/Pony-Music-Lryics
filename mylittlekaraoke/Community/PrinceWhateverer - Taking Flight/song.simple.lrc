[00:21.23]You see us fly through the sky
[00:24.30] Flight goggles shining bright
[00:26.62]With wings of steel faster than anypony who can fly
[00:31.57]We are the speedy cure
[00:33.90]We're what you're looking for
[00:36.30]The antidote sent to impress crowds who always want more
[00:41.10]Some say that we're all fake
[00:43.50]Boy that's a big mistake
[00:45.90]I challenge anypony, life or death, your choice to make
[00:50.70]'Cause we will not back down
[00:53.10]I'll turn this right around
[00:55.50]These rumors stain our legacy
[00:57.98]Of which we are so proud
[01:02.40]Now we refuse to let you win
[01:07.20]You're a liar and always has been
[01:12.00]Now I refuse to let you win
[01:16.72]You're a liar and always has been
[01:24.38]There are dark stories of our past that I bet you don't know
[01:29.10]The truth about where we came from kept secret even though
[01:33.90]We are so famous, these secrets shame us
[01:38.70]Lab rats from day one until somepony dare save us
[01:43.50]So desperate were we to be known by all Equestria
[01:48.30]We sold our soul and so ourselves unto Celestia~
[01:53.17]And now we don't even know where we stand within this place
[01:57.90]Just doing as we're told and hoping one day that we'll escape
[02:03.38]With all these years I've wasted
[02:07.50]If only I was brave enough to face it
[02:12.60]This was too good to be true from the very start
[02:17.32]I should never have believed this was from the heart
[02:24.30]We were but young ponies so absorbed in our dreams
[02:29.10]It took so long to realize that we had been tricked with ease
[02:33.90]Such promises of fame and fortune were too much to take
[02:38.70]If asked the same question right now, I'd make the same mistake
[02:43.50]For even though I do regret the things that I~ have done
[02:48.30]I'd rather take all of the blame myself for everyone
[02:53.10]It's better to live with it all and save the ones I need
[02:57.90]Than just give in and let it bring all of us to our knees
[03:10.12](Leave us a)-lone-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
[03:21.60]-Oh!-
[03:36.97]With all these years I've wasted
[03:41.10]If only I was brave enough to face it
[03:46.20]This was too good to be true from the very start
[03:50.93]I should never have believed this was from the heart
[03:56.18]With all these years I've wasted
[04:00.30]If only I was brave enough to face it
[04:05.40]This was too good to be true from the very start
[04:10.12]I should never have believed this was from the heart
