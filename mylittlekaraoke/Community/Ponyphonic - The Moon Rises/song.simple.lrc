[00:17.66]Now the hour has come at last
[00:20.07]The soft and fading light
[00:23.17]Has crossed the west horizon
[00:25.67]And has bidden us goodnight
[00:29.00]And what a lovely night it is
[00:32.15]To walk a moonlit field
[00:35.02]To see the softer shades
[00:37.24]That are by starlight now revealed
[00:40.81]So why is it that now
[00:43.03]When all is quiet and at rest
[00:46.73]When candles glow and all the world
[00:49.60]Is at its very best
[00:52.66]The ponies of Equestria
[00:55.53]Should lock themselves away
[00:58.45]To shun the moon and wait instead
[01:01.36]For Sister's sunny day?
[01:09.84]In umbra Luna est
[01:14.56]Am I so wrong to wish that they
[01:17.52]Would see things like I do?
[01:20.90]And am I so wrong to think
[01:23.40]That they might love me too?
[01:26.55]Why shouldn't they adore me?
[01:29.51]Is it not within my right?
[01:32.34]I'll not be overshadowed
[01:35.02]Mine is not the lesser light
[01:38.26]I've waited long enough now
[01:41.09]For them all to come around
[01:43.59]And though the Sun may plead and threaten
[01:47.06]The Moon will stand her ground
[01:50.25]And all will know the wonder
[01:52.98]Of my dark and jeweled sky
[01:56.09]When all the world is wrapped
[01:58.45]In an eternal lullaby
[02:01.92]So say goodnight at this
[02:04.28]The final setting of the sun
[02:08.03]Tomorrow dawns in darkness
[02:10.95]The nighttime has begun!
[02:15.21]Nocte!
