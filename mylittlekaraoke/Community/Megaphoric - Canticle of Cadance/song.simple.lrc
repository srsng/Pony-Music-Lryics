[00:08.81]Why is this world that is yearni-ing
[00:13.91]For love so easily thrown?
[00:19.54]Why is your heart that is hurting
[00:24.26]So twisted and wickedly so
[00:29.06]The darkness is coming
[00:31.99]To bid on your soul
[00:34.76]You can't let it win now
[00:37.46]You're stronger, yo-u know?
[00:41.96]Just give me-e your hearts, dears
[00:44.93]I'll make them anew
[00:47.96]Lay down your crosses and bo-ows
[00:53.25]Come toward the light now
[00:55.73]Just push thro-ugh the rain
[00:58.80]Love is in bloom
[01:00.98] And love will vanquish the pain
[01:07.43]We'll vanquish the pain
[01:14.14]Why is this soul that is suffering
[01:18.64]Refusing my comforting to-ouch?
[01:23.70]Why do they taunt me and scorn me
[01:28.16]When I'm just the o-one they should trust
[01:32.81]The darkness is coming
[01:35.66]To bid on your soul
[01:38.03]You can't let it win though
[01:40.61]You're stronger, yo-u know
[01:45.26]Just give me-e your hearts, dears
[01:48.11]I'll make them anew
[01:50.96]Lay down your crosses and bo-ows
[01:56.10]Come toward the light now
[01:58.43]Just push thro-ugh the rain
[02:01.43]Love is in bloom
[02:03.60]And love will vanquish the pain
[02:09.83]We'll vanquish the pa-a-a-a-in
[02:18.90]Heartache's consuming
[02:21.23]A dangerous foe
[02:23.59]Its freezi-ing embra-ace
[02:26.21]Will smother all hope
[02:28.91]But don't let it trap you
[02:31.58]Tear down the walls
[02:33.83]Never stop yearning
[02:36.15]For love's gentle call
[02:42.00]Give me-e your hearts, dears
[02:44.44]I'll make them anew
[02:47.25]Lay down your crosses and bo-ows
[02:52.39]Come toward the light now
[02:54.86]Just push thro-ugh the rain
[02:57.83]Love is in bloom
[03:00.04]And love will vanquish the pain
[03:06.71]We'll vanquish the pa-a-ain
[03:12.04]Will vanquish the pain
