[00:02.73][P1] Haven't we all had enough of Diamond Tiara?
[00:05.69][P1] Do we really need a big statue of her?
[00:08.43][P1] Especially where our playground equipment should be?
[00:15.89][P1] A vote for Pip is a vote for the playground
[00:18.74][P2] A vote for Diamond Tiara is a vote
[00:21.11][P2] For more Diamond Tiara
[00:24.29][P1] It's time to make a change
[00:26.43][P1] This is our chance
[00:28.61][P1] Don't be afraid to do what's right
[00:30.89][P1] He's it, vote for Pip!
[00:32.88][P1] We got an opportunity
[00:35.02][P1] To have fun again
[00:36.89][P1] A vote for Pip and you can join the fight
[00:40.57][P1] It's time for a new leader
[00:43.04][P1] It's time to make a change
[00:44.99][P1] We're here to fight for what we believe
[00:48.44][P1] Vote for Pip!
[00:49.27][P1] It's finally time we beat her
[00:51.78][P1] And play a better game
[00:53.65][P1] 'Cause when we vote together
[00:56.13][P1] There's nothing that we can't achieve
[01:02.32][P2] I don't believe what I am hearing
[01:04.08][P2] I'm the only one you should be cheering
[01:05.95][P2] Pipsqueak, try Pips-weak, don't you think?
[01:09.22][P2] But a diamond is perfection
[01:11.02][P2] It's natural selection
[01:12.74][P2] So your vote better be for me
[01:14.32][P2] Not the weakest link
[01:15.56][P1] We'll let the voting decide
[01:18.56][P2] Everypony has their little secrets
[01:23.36][P2] I know you do
[01:25.38][P2] A vote for me will help you keep them safe
[01:30.18][P2] Like your creepy super strength
[01:32.58][P2] Or your mane extension
[01:34.27][P2] A little thing I won't mention
[01:36.18][P2] Or those freakish large teeth in your face
[01:38.77][P1] C'mon now ponies, don't listen to her!
[01:42.18][P1] You've gotta vote for change
[01:44.32][P1] It's time for a new leader
[01:46.53][P1] End all the tyranny
[01:48.70][P1] Vote now and we can beat her
[01:50.88][P1] It's now another day
[01:53.09][P1] And we believe in what's right
[01:55.27][P1] Vote for Pip! Vote for Pip!
[01:57.44][P1] Our victory is in sight
[01:59.77][P2] Stop!
[02:00.37][P2] Everypony who hasn't voted, listen up!
[02:03.03][P2] Pip makes promises he can't keep
[02:05.06][P2] But I can do more
[02:07.04][P2] You could really use a new book bag
[02:09.25][P2] 'Cause I'll make things happen
[02:10.98][P2] That none of you here can afford
[02:13.45][P2] To do, like ever
[02:16.34][P2] Wouldn't you like a little something sweet?
[02:18.07][P2] Here's a parasol to hide you from the heat
[02:19.72][P2] Who says tha-at I can't be nice?
[02:22.83][P2] But first there's one thing
[02:24.52][P2] An itsy-bitsy little string
[02:26.20][P2] And voting for me is the price
[02:30.25][P2] I've a tiny suggestion
[02:32.99][P2] That you should be aware
[02:36.97][P2] You could probably win this election
[02:40.12][P2] If you showed them all you reaâ€¦
[02:43.19][P2] I don't recall asking you to speak!
[02:45.25][P1] GASP!
[02:46.53][P1] Well, if that's how you treat your best friend
[02:48.67][P1] Then I choose Pipsqueak!
[02:51.03][P1] Stand strong and don't be afraid
[02:55.08][P1] Let's free ourselves from the past
[02:57.41][P1] He's it! Vote for Pip!
[02:59.47][P1] We'll let honor win out
[03:01.79][P1] Against the tyranny
[03:03.89][P1] And make a change that will last
[03:06.29][P1] Vote for Pip!
[03:07.12][P1] It's time for a new leader
[03:09.63][P1] It's time to make a change
[03:11.54][P1] We're here to fight for what we believe
[03:15.03][P1] Vote for Pip!
[03:15.89][P1] It's finally time we beat her
[03:18.33][P1] And play a better game
[03:20.20][P1] 'Cause when we vote together
[03:22.75][P1] There's nothing that we can't achieve
[03:27.10][P1] Vote for Pip!
