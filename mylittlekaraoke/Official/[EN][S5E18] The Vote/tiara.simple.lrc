[00:18.74]A vote for Diamond Tiara is a vote
[00:21.11]For more Diamond Tiara
[01:02.32]I don't believe what I am hearing
[01:04.08]I'm the only one you should be cheering
[01:05.95]Pipsqueak, try Pips-weak, don't you think?
[01:09.22]But a diamond is perfection
[01:11.02]It's natural selection
[01:12.74]So your vote better be for me
[01:14.32]Not the weakest link
[01:18.56]Everypony has their little secrets
[01:23.36]I know you do
[01:25.38]A vote for me will help you keep them safe
[01:30.18]Like your creepy super strength
[01:32.58]Or your mane extension
[01:34.27]A little thing I won't mention
[01:36.18]Or those freakish large teeth in your face
[01:59.77]Stop!
[02:00.37]Everypony who hasn't voted, listen up!
[02:03.03]Pip makes promises he can't keep
[02:05.06]But I can do more
[02:07.04]You could really use a new book bag
[02:09.25]'Cause I'll make things happen
[02:10.98]That none of you here can afford
[02:13.45]To do, like ever
[02:16.34]Wouldn't you like a little something sweet?
[02:18.07]Here's a parasol to hide you from the heat
[02:19.72]Who says tha-at I can't be nice?
[02:22.83]But first there's one thing
[02:24.52]An itsy-bitsy little string
[02:26.20]And voting for me is the price
[02:30.25]I've a tiny suggestion
[02:32.99]That you should be aware
[02:36.97]You could probably win this election
[02:40.12]If you showed them all you reaâ€¦
[02:43.19]I don't recall asking you to speak!
