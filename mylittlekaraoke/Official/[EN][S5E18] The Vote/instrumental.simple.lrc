[00:02.73]Haven't we all had enough of Diamond Tiara?
[00:05.69]Do we really need a big statue of her?
[00:08.43]Especially where our playground equipment should be?
[00:15.89]A vote for Pip is a vote for the playground
[00:18.74]A vote for Diamond Tiara is a vote
[00:21.11]For more Diamond Tiara
[00:24.29]It's time to make a change
[00:26.43]This is our chance
[00:28.61]Don't be afraid to do what's right
[00:30.89]He's it, vote for Pip!
[00:32.88]We got an opportunity
[00:35.02]To have fun again
[00:36.89]A vote for Pip and you can join the fight
[00:40.57]It's time for a new leader
[00:43.04]It's time to make a change
[00:44.99]We're here to fight for what we believe
[00:48.44]Vote for Pip!
[00:49.27]It's finally time we beat her
[00:51.78]And play a better game
[00:53.65]'Cause when we vote together
[00:56.13]There's nothing that we can't achieve
[01:02.32]I don't believe what I am hearing
[01:04.08]I'm the only one you should be cheering
[01:05.95]Pipsqueak, try Pips-weak, don't you think?
[01:09.22]But a diamond is perfection
[01:11.02]It's natural selection
[01:12.74]So your vote better be for me
[01:14.32]Not the weakest link
[01:15.56]We'll let the voting decide
[01:18.56]Everypony has their little secrets
[01:23.36]I know you do
[01:25.38]A vote for me will help you keep them safe
[01:30.18]Like your creepy super strength
[01:32.58]Or your mane extension
[01:34.27]A little thing I won't mention
[01:36.18]Or those freakish large teeth in your face
[01:38.77]C'mon now ponies, don't listen to her!
[01:42.18]You've gotta vote for change
[01:44.32]It's time for a new leader
[01:46.53]End all the tyranny
[01:48.70]Vote now and we can beat her
[01:50.88]It's now another day
[01:53.09]And we believe in what's right
[01:55.27]Vote for Pip! Vote for Pip!
[01:57.44]Our victory is in sight
[01:59.77]Stop!
[02:00.37]Everypony who hasn't voted, listen up!
[02:03.03]Pip makes promises he can't keep
[02:05.06]But I can do more
[02:07.04]You could really use a new book bag
[02:09.25]'Cause I'll make things happen
[02:10.98]That none of you here can afford
[02:13.45]To do, like ever
[02:16.34]Wouldn't you like a little something sweet?
[02:18.07]Here's a parasol to hide you from the heat
[02:19.72]Who says tha-at I can't be nice?
[02:22.83]But first there's one thing
[02:24.52]An itsy-bitsy little string
[02:26.20]And voting for me is the price
[02:30.25]I've a tiny suggestion
[02:32.99]That you should be aware
[02:36.97]You could probably win this election
[02:40.12]If you showed them all you reaâ€¦
[02:43.19]I don't recall asking you to speak!
[02:45.25]GASP!
[02:46.53]Well, if that's how you treat your best friend
[02:48.67]Then I choose Pipsqueak!
[02:51.03]Stand strong and don't be afraid
[02:55.08]Let's free ourselves from the past
[02:57.41]He's it! Vote for Pip!
[02:59.47]We'll let honor win out
[03:01.79]Against the tyranny
[03:03.89]And make a change that will last
[03:06.29]Vote for Pip!
[03:07.12]It's time for a new leader
[03:09.63]It's time to make a change
[03:11.54]We're here to fight for what we believe
[03:15.03]Vote for Pip!
[03:15.89]It's finally time we beat her
[03:18.33]And play a better game
[03:20.20]'Cause when we vote together
[03:22.75]There's nothing that we can't achieve
[03:27.10]Vote for Pip!
