For every day
I look around me
For every time I se you near
I thank the stars
Whose light surrounds me
I thank the earth that keeps you here
'Cause I will only follow
My true heart
And I can see it clear now
Right from the start
You were My Little Pony
I used to wonder what friendship could be
My Little Pony
Until you shared its magic with me
You saw the change
That we all needed
You saw how good that we could be
We'll never let little things come between us
Now that we found this destiny
And we can stand up tall now
To any hate
'Cause best friends stick together
We love and tolerate
My Little Pony
I used to wonder what friendship could be
My Little Pony
Until you shared its magic with me
If one falls down
We all come around
Yeah, you're so free
To be anything,
Anything that you want to be, yeah
My Little Pony
I used to wonder what friendship could be
My Little Pony
Until you shared its magic with me
My Little Pony
I used to wonder what friendship could be
My little pony
Until you shared its magic with me
