[01:29.00]Been dreamin', I've been waiting
[01:31.08]To fly with those great ponies
[01:33.17]The Wonderbolts, their daring tricks

[01:55.54]I am here at the Grand Gala
[01:57.67]For it is the best party
[01:59.75]But the one thing it was missing
[02:01.58]Was a pony named Pinkie!
[02:04.00]For I am the best at parties
[02:05.79]All the ponies will agree
[02:08.12]Ponies playing, ponies dancing
[02:10.17]With me at the Grand Gala!

[02:54.38]Into the Gala, find my prince!
[02:56.38]Prove I'm great as a Wonderbolt is
[02:58.21]To meet! To sell! To find!
[02:59.79]To prove! To whoop! To talk!
