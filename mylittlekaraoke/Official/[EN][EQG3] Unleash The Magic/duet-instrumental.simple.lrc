[00:00.40][P1] I realize that you've always been an outcast
[00:04.19][P1] It's not everyone at school who likes to think
[00:08.01][P1] To find a student that's like you
[00:10.22][P1] I've had one or maybe two
[00:12.33][P1] But the good ones disappear before I blink
[00:14.84][P2] Oh-uh-wah-uh-wah
[00:16.30][P2] Oh-oh oh-uh-wah-uh-wah
[00:18.36][P1] Now, I understand you have your reservations
[00:22.49][P2] Uh-wah
[00:22.60][P1] It's hard to have a brain as large as yours
[00:25.49][P2] Ah-ah-ah ah
[00:26.42][P1] But if we don't win these games
[00:28.45][P1] Well, I think I've made it plain
[00:29.20][P2] Ah-ah
[00:30.47][P1] What will happen if we have the losing scores
[00:32.20][P2] Oh oh-uh-wah-uh-wah
[00:34.49][P2] Oh-oh oh-uh-wah-uh-wah
[00:36.25][P1] Unleash the magic, unleash the ma-agic
[00:40.52][P1] If we lose, then you're to blame
[00:43.56][P2] Ah-ah-ah
[00:44.35][P1] They all have used it, maybe abu-used it
[00:47.61][P2] Ah-ah
[00:48.59][P1] So then why can't we do the same?
[00:51.21][P2] Oh-uh-wah-uh-wah
[00:52.67][P2] Oh-oh oh-uh-wah-uh-wah
[00:54.66][P1] Call it power, call it magic
[00:56.16][P2] Magic
[00:56.76][P1] If we lose, it will be tragic
[00:58.19][P2] Tragic
[00:58.79][P1] More important is the knowledge we'll have lost
[01:01.75][P2] Ah-ah-ah ah
[01:02.46][P1] A chance like this won't come again
[01:04.75][P1] You'll regret not giving in
[01:06.78][P1] Isn't understanding magic worth the cost?
[01:09.33][P2] Oh-uh-wah-uh-wah
[01:10.79][P2] Oh-oh oh-uh-wah-uh-wah
[01:12.55][P1] Unleash the magic, unleash the ma-agic
[01:16.75][P1] We're not friends here after all
[01:20.43][P1] Our only interest in this business
[01:23.76][P2] Ah-ah-ah
[01:24.36][P1] Is seeing Canterlot High School fall
[01:27.10][P2] Oh-uh-wah-uh-wah
[01:28.53][P2] Oh-oh oh-uh-wah-uh-wah
[01:30.55][P2] Oh-uh-wah
[01:31.26][P1] What I'm suggesting's very simple
[01:31.79][P2] Ah-ah
[01:35.24][P1] And since it's win-win on all scores
[01:35.50][P2] Ah-ah
[01:38.91][P2] Ah-ah-ah-ah
[01:39.18][P1] You only want to learn about the
[01:42.78][P1] Magic that you have stored
[01:42.81][P2] Ah
[01:47.01][P1] And as for me and all the others
[01:47.43][P2] Ah-ah-ah
[01:50.91][P1] We only want what we deserve
[01:54.66][P2] Ah
[01:55.11][P1] That our school will clinch the win
[01:58.11][P1] And my legacy will endure
[01:58.56][P2] Legacy will endure
[02:01.83][P1] Unleash the magic, unleash the ma-agic
[02:05.91][P1] If we lose, then it's a crime
[02:09.62][P1] But we can win it if you begi-in it
[02:12.93][P2] Ah-ah-ah
[02:13.56][P1] It's up to you to not fail this time
[02:16.38][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:20.31][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:24.29][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:24.36][P1] Imagine all I-I'll learn by setting i-it free
[02:28.26][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:32.05][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:32.28][P1] And now winning these games depends o-on me
[02:36.18][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:39.89][P1] And what doors might open if I try to use it
[02:39.89][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:43.83][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:48.14][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:48.21][P1] But the magic's what I really want to se-e
[02:51.93][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:55.64][P1] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:55.71][P2] Unleash the magic, free the magic
[02:59.50][P1] Now!
[02:59.58][P2] Now!
