Power
Was all I desired
But all that grew inside me
Was a darkness I aquired
When I began to fall
And I lost the path ahead
That's when your friendship found me
And it lifted me instead
Like a phoenix burnin' bright
In the sky
I'll show there's another side to me
You can't deny
I may not know what the future holds
But hear me when I say
That my past does not define me
'Cause my past is not today
Ambition
Is what I believed
Would be the only way
To set me free
But when it disappeared
And I found myself alone
That's when you came and got me
And I felt like I was home
Like a phoenix burnin' bright
In the sky
I'll show there's another side to me
You can't deny
I may not know what the future holds
But hear me when I say
That my past does not define me
'Cause my past is not today
