[00:01.47]These animals don't listen, 
[00:03.51]no, not one little bit 
[00:05.54]They run around out of control 
[00:07.58]and throw their hissy fits 
[00:09.62]It's up to me to stop them, 
[00:11.66]'cause plainly you can see 
[00:13.76]It's got to be my destiny, 
[00:16.49]and it's what my cutie mark is telling me 
[00:22.80]I try to keep them laughing, 
[00:24.58]put a smile upon their face
[00:26.68]But no matter what I try, 
[00:28.46]it seems a bit of a disgrace 
[00:30.95]I have to entertain them, 
[00:33.05]it's there for all to see 
[00:35.02]It's got to be my destiny, 
[00:37.82]and it's what my cutie mark is telling me 
[00:44.19]I don't care much for pickin' fruit 
[00:46.22]and plowin' fields ain't such a hoot 
[00:48.39]No matter what I try, 
[00:49.79]I cannot fix this busted water chute 
[00:53.35]I've got so many chores to do, 
[00:55.39]it's no fun being me 
[00:57.37]But it has to be my destiny, 
[01:00.23]'cause it's what my cutie mark is telling me 
[01:06.85]Lookie here at what I made, 
[01:08.63]I think that it's a dress 
[01:10.67]I know it doesn't look like much, 
[01:12.71]I'm under some distress 
[01:14.68]Could y'all give me a hand here 
[01:16.72]and help me fix this mess 
[01:18.76]My destiny is not pretty, 
[01:21.56]but it's what my cutie mark is tellin' me 
[01:27.73]I'm in love with weather patterns 
[01:29.77]but the others have concerns 
[01:32.00]For I just gave them frostbite 
[01:33.78]over top of their sunburns 
[01:37.03]I have to keep on trying 
[01:39.06]for everyone can see 
[01:41.04]It's got to be 
[01:43.20]My destiny 
[01:45.05]And it's what my cutie mark 
[01:47.47]It's what my cutie mark 
[01:49.44]Yes, it's what my cutie mark is telling me
