You've come
Such a long, long way
And I've watched you
From that very first day
To see how you might grow
To see what you might do
To see what you've been through
And all the ways
You've made me proud of you
It's time now
For a new change to come
You've grown up
And your new life has begun
To go where you will go
To see what you will see
To find what you will be
For it's time for you
To fulfill
Your destiny
Twilight, is that you?
