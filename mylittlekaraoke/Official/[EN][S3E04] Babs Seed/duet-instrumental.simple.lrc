[00:10.75][P1] A new friend to have
[00:12.31][P1] Then it seemed like such a treat

[00:50.03][P1] Hidin' from a bully,
[00:51.59][P1] We know it isn't right
[00:53.14][P1] But the Cutie Mark Crusaders,
[00:54.98][P1] We aren't lookin' for a fight
[00:57.37][P2] Oh, she'll go home soon,
[00:58.70][P2] And then we'll have some peace again
