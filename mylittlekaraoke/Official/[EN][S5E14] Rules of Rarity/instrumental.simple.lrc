[00:08.28]The Rules of Rarity
[00:09.88]Guaranteed quality
[00:11.06]This I can assure
[00:13.23]For each and every dress
[00:15.71]I vow to give finesse
[00:18.15]With ti-ime, lo-ove, and couture
[00:32.19]My favorite moment's when a pony sees it
[00:37.07]That special gown that she just adores
[00:42.02]That pony's now in style
[00:44.49]My hard work's all worthwhile
[00:46.89]Oh, yes, it ma-akes my heart
[00:49.33]My heart just so-o-oar
[01:17.65]The Rules of Rarity
[01:19.44]Just a parody
[01:20.93]No dress here's u-unique
[01:23.52]The panels all the same
[01:26.53]Each colored windowpane
[01:29.15]I fashion only makes me want to shriek!
[01:34.41]*sigh*
[01:35.89]Oh, to create would give me elation
[01:40.84]To feel once again some inspiration
[01:46.93]Come on now, Rarity
[01:49.60]Give me some clarity
[01:51.92]Time for your couture love to rule
[01:56.60]The Rules of Rarity, extra TLC
[01:59.35]This feels more sublime
[02:01.71]Soon now, they will see
[02:02.92]How good these can be
[02:04.14]With a little extra shine
[02:06.31]The Rules of Rarity guaranteed quality
[02:09.05]All can see it's true
[02:11.15]These new gems add such flair
[02:13.55]Their beauty can't compare
[02:16.02]This old style suddenly gleams anew
[02:22.00]Hmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
[02:34.83]The Rules of Rarity once
[02:37.61]Stood for something
[02:40.28]But now it feels just like some factory
[02:45.76]Now every dress I make
[02:48.31]With every flaw and mistake
[02:50.90]Oh, how it ma-akes my heart
[02:53.41]My heart just break
[03:04.19]How can I have forgotten?
[03:06.24]This is what I have been dreaming about!
[03:10.77]My favorite moment's when a pony sees it
[03:15.38]That special gown that she just adores
[03:20.02]That pony's now in style
[03:22.27]My hard work's all worthwhile
[03:24.63]Oh, yes, it ma-akes my heart
[03:26.92]My heart just so-ar
