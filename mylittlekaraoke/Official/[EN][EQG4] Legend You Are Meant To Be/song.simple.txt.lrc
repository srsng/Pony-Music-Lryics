I used to think that stories were just that
Set in stone, concrete as a fact
It didn't dawn on me
That I could change history
Now I know I'm writing my own song
Fight my way to the ending that I want
I'll turn a tragedy
Into an epic fantasy
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You can be a hero, too
Ohoh
Take my hand, I'm here for you
Come away with me
Be the legend you are meant to be
You'll always be ever free
Oh, oowah, ahoh, oowah, ahoh, oowah
To be the legend you are meant to be
Oh, oowah, ahoh, oowah, ahoh, oowah
To be the legend you are meant to be
There was a time when fear would hold me down
'Cause I let it chain me to the ground
Look at me now, I'm soaring high
It's never boring in the sky
When I know I've got friends on my side
Whatever trials, I'll take them all in stride
Together we will shine so bright
A radiant brilliance in the night
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You can be a hero, too
Ohoh
Take my hand, I'm here for you
Come away with me
Be the legend you are meant to be
You'll always be ever free
Oh, oowah, ahoh, oowah, ahoh, oowah
To be the legend you are meant to be
Oh, oowah, ahoh, oowah, ahoh, oowah
To be the legend you are meant to be
