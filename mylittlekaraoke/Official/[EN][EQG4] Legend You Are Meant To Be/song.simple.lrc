[00:08.86]I used to think that stories were just that
[00:12.42]Set in stone, concrete as a-a fact
[00:15.68]It didn't dawn on me
[00:18.42]That I could change history
[00:22.77]Now I kno-ow I'm writi-ing my-y own song
[00:26.15]Fight my way to the ending that I want
[00:29.37]I'll turn a tragedy
[00:32.18]Into an epic fantasy-y
[00:35.97]Hey! Hey! Hey!
[00:38.56]You can be a hero, too
[00:42.83]Oh-oh-oh
[00:45.38]Take my hand, I'm here for you
[00:49.70]Come away with me
[00:54.42]Be the legend you are meant to be
[00:57.83]You'll always be ever free
[01:03.46]Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah
[01:07.96]To be the legend you are meant to be
[01:10.32]Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah
[01:14.82]To be the legend you are meant to be
[01:17.45]There was a ti-ime when fear would hold me down
[01:21.01]'Cause I let it chain me to the ground
[01:24.20]Look at me no-ow, I'm soaring high
[01:27.20]It's never bo-oring in the sky-y
[01:31.28]When I kno-ow I've got friends o-on my side
[01:34.51]Whatever tri-als, I'll take them all in stride
[01:37.96]Together we will shine so bright
[01:40.96]A radiant brilliance in the night
[01:44.56]Hey! Hey! Hey!
[01:47.15]You can be a hero, too
[01:51.46]Oh-oh-oh
[01:53.97]Take my hand, I'm here for you
[01:58.28]Come away with me
[02:03.01]Be the legend you are meant to be
[02:06.38]You'll always be ever free
[02:11.97]Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah
[02:16.51]To be the legend you are meant to be
[02:18.83]Oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah, ah-oh, oo-wah
[02:23.37]To be the legend you are meant to be
