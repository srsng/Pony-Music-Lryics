[00:02.41]I fear I told a little fib
[00:05.26]About my pony past
[00:07.74]I hope that when you hear the truth
[00:10.47]You will not be aghast
[00:13.25]I wasn't quite the super party pony like I claimed
[00:18.46]The fact is that I was so shy
[00:21.27]Nopony knew my-y name
[00:28.25]I stumbled into Ponyville
[00:30.46]One afternoon by chance
[00:32.60]And found the biggest ever celebration party dance
[00:37.25]Everything was perfect
[00:38.90]Cheer was filling up the place
[00:41.34]And I saw that everypony had
[00:43.47]A smile upon their face
[00:45.69]I vowed that day to change my life
[00:48.05]The past I did set free
[00:50.11]For now Cheese Sandwich was
[00:51.69] A party pony full of glee
[00:54.46]A super duper party pony
[00:56.94]That's what I became
[00:58.81]I traveled all Equestria
[01:01.06]And all did know my name
[01:04.62]But that never would have happened on my own
[01:08.41]I'll tell you why
[01:11.56]For the one who threw that party
[01:13.85]It was you, Pinkie Pie
