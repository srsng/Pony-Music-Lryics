[00:00.32]There's music in the treetops
[00:02.42]And there's music in the vale
[00:04.59]And all around the music fills the sky
[00:08.94]There's music by the river
[00:11.19]And there's music in the grass
[00:13.37]And the music makes your heart soar in reply
[00:20.46]You've got to look inside and find
[00:24.81]The music deep inside you
[00:29.16]'Cause when you look inside you'll se-e it
[00:33.51]You're gonna find it gonna find
[00:37.78]Got the music
[00:38.83]Got the music
[00:39.88]Got the music in you
