Love is in bloom
A beautiful bride
A handsome groom
Two hearts
Becoming one
A bond that cannot be undone because
Love is in blom
A beautiful bride, a handsome groom
I said, love is in blom
You're starting a life
And making room
For us
Twilight!
None of this would have been possible
Without you, little sis
Love ya, Twily
Love you too, B.B.B.F.F.
Ready to go?
Oh, almost forgot!
MIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE!
Love is in blom
A beautiful bride, a handsome groom
I said, love is in blom
You're starting a life
And making room
For us
For us
