I never thought that I would find a place
To step right in and start again
I never thought that I could just begin
Right where I left off and make a friend
Don't ever think that it might be to late
You don't have to wait,
There's no mistakes with the friends you make
A friendship's only made of what you bring
And if you do it right, you can do anything
Just use your eyes
This time, no lies
Just don't disguise
Who you are inside
Because your friends are always there for you
You don't have to be the same
For friendship to be true
Because your friends are always there for you
Around the world, it's still the same
Together you have more to gain
There's nothing that a friend won't do
Ev'rywhere you go
Friendship there will grow
When you find it, it's the key
Friends can change the world, you se
Ev'rywhere you go
Friendship there will grow
When you find it, it's the key
Friends can change the world
Friends can change the world
Friends can change the world, you see
