[00:06.39]I never thought that I would find a place
[00:12.16]To step right in and start a-ga-in
[00:18.05]I never thought that I could just begin
[00:23.27]Right where I left off and ma-a-ake a friend
[00:29.83]Do-on't ever think that it might be to-o late
[00:35.45]You don't have to wa-it,
[00:36.91]There's no mista-akes with the friends you make
[00:41.27]A friendship's only made of what yo-u-u bring
[00:46.06]And if you do it ri-i-ight, you can do anything
[00:51.65]Just use your eyes
[00:54.54]This time, no-o lies
[00:57.39]Just don't disguise
[01:01.14]Who you are insi-ide
[01:04.59]Because your friends are always there for yo-u
[01:09.80]You don't have to be the same
[01:12.35]For friendship to be tru-e
[01:16.18]Because your friends are always there for yo-u
[01:21.28]Around the world, it's still the same
[01:24.20]Together you have more to gain
[01:27.09]There's nothing that a friend wo-o-on't do
[01:31.03]Ev'rywhere yo-u go
[01:33.84]Friendship there wi-ill grow
[01:36.35]When you find it, it's the-e key
[01:39.47]Friends can change the world, you se-e
[01:42.58]Ev'rywhere yo-u go
[01:45.43]Friendship there wi-ill grow
[01:48.02]When you find it, it's the key
[01:50.56]Friends can change the world
[01:53.49]Friends can change the world
[01:56.34]Friends can change the world, you see
