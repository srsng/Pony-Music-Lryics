[00:08.31][P1] We're off
[00:08.31][P2] We're off
[00:09.86][P1] On the road to friendship
[00:09.86][P2] On the road to friendship
[00:12.59][P1] Our ride might be tiny and small
[00:12.59][P2] Our ride might be tiny and small
[00:15.42][P1] Beats walking though eh, Trix?
[00:16.48][P2] I am walking
[00:18.02][P2] But road trips are a great way, we've been told, to get along
[00:22.26][P1] I'm glad we're sticking to it
[00:24.15][P1] We've already got a song
[00:24.15][P2] We've already got a song
[00:26.62][P1] We're off
[00:26.62][P2] We're off
[00:28.08][P1] On the road to friendship
[00:28.08][P2] On the road to friendship
[00:30.51][P1] Side by side just like peas in a pod
[00:30.51][P2] Side by side just like peas in a pod
[00:34.61][P1] Our bond of friendship is stronger
[00:34.61][P2] Our bond of friendship is stronger
[00:37.08][P1] Than this tour's demands
[00:37.08][P2] Than this tour's demands
[00:41.84][P1] Wait, what did he say?
[00:42.90][P2] Nothing!
[00:44.01][P1] We're so tight, we can't move around
[00:44.01][P2] We're so tight, we can't move around
[00:47.98][P1] I guess we're stuck together
[00:47.98][P2] I guess we're stuck together
[00:49.87][P1] 'Cause we're friendship
[00:49.87][P2] 'Cause we're friendship bound
[00:52.26][P2] Sure is great traveling with you, buddy!
[00:54.42][P1] You too, buddy!
[00:59.80][P1] We're off
[00:59.80][P2] We're off
[01:01.30][P1] On the road to friendship
[01:01.30][P2] On the road to friendship
[01:02.80][P2] Yes, we are!
[01:04.03][P1] We've each got the other to blame
[01:04.03][P2] We've each got the other to blame
[01:08.05][P1] Any trip can be exhausting
[01:10.26][P1] If you make a fuss
[01:12.64][P2] But we get on so well
[01:14.23][P2] That's there no way that could be us
[01:16.92][P1] We're off
[01:16.92][P2] We're off
[01:18.46][P1] On the road to friendship
[01:18.46][P2] On the road to friendship
[01:20.93][P1] And there's nowhere that we'd rather be
[01:20.93][P2] And there's nowhere that we'd rather be
[01:24.11][P2] Was that off-key?
[01:25.52][P1] In summer, winter, spring, and fall
[01:27.68][P1] We're friends throughout the year
[01:29.84][P2] For untold seasons yet to come
[01:31.92][P2] Our friendship will be here
[01:33.37][P1] For nine, at least!
[01:34.39][P1] We're so tight we can't move around
[01:34.39][P2] We're so tight we can't move around
[01:38.36][P2] Like a race where you tie your hooves together
[01:39.77][P2] And you have to move
[01:40.21][P2] In perfect synchronization to win!
[01:42.11][P1] We're friendship bound
[01:42.11][P2] We're friendship bound
[01:46.43][P1] Or like a buddy movie where the two protagonists
[01:48.20][P1] Can't get away from each other
[01:49.17][P1] Because they're wearing hoof-cuffs!
[01:50.40][P1] We're friendship bound!
[01:50.40][P2] We're friendship bound!
