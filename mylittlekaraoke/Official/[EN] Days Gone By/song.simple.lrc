[00:19.30]When family ca-annot be here
[00:23.71]Havin' journeyed far and wi-ide
[00:28.45]We sing a song to honor them
[00:33.11]To remember da-ays gone by
[00:38.11]So take your cup a-and raise it high
[00:42.51]Just as surely I'll do mi-ine
[00:47.29]And laugh we will at stories told
[00:52.03]As we smi-ile at da-ays gone by
[00:56.69]As we smi-ile at da-ays gone by
[01:03.64]For family not here, my dears
[01:08.41]Havin' journeyed far and wide
[01:13.08]For loyalty and kindness both
[01:17.85]We smile at days gone by
[01:39.38]Our paths will cross a-again one day
[01:43.75]I-in time to reuni-ite
[01:48.49]For family is always near
[01:53.11]Even when the seas are wide
[01:58.04]So take your cup a-and raise it high
[02:02.48]Just as surely I'll do mi-ine
[02:07.26]And make a toast for family
[02:11.99]And the ta-ales of da-ays gone by
[02:16.59]For family not here, my dears
[02:21.32]Havin' journeyed far and wide
[02:26.03]Fo-or loyalty and kindness both
[02:30.76]Ta-ake joy at days gone by
[02:35.43]Fo-or loyalty and kindness both
[02:40.17]We-e smile at days gone by
