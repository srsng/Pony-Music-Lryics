When family cannot be here
Havin' journeyed far and wide
We sing a song to honor them
To remember days gone by
So take your cup and raise it high
Just as surely I'll do mine
And laugh we will at stories told
As we smile at days gone by
As we smile at days gone by
For family not here, my dears
Havin' journeyed far and wide
For loyalty and kindness both
We smile at days gone by
Our paths will cross again one day
Iin time to reunite
For family is always near
Even when the seas are wide
So take your cup and raise it high
Just as surely I'll do mine
And make a toast for family
And the tales of days gone by
For family not here, my dears
Havin' journeyed far and wide
For loyalty and kindness both
Take joy at days gone by
For loyalty and kindness both
We smile at days gone by
