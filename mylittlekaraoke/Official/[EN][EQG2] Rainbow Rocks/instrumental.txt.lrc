We used to fight with each other
Oh-wo-ah-wo-ah-wo-oah
That was before we discovered
Oh-wo-ah-wo-ah-wo-oah
That when your friendship is real
Oh-wo-ah-wo-ah-wo-oah
Yeah, You just say what you feel
And the mu~sic
Yeah, the mu~sic
Gets us to the top~
As we learn how the Rainbow
Rainbow~ Rocks
You can pick up the bass
Oh-wo-ah-wo-ah-wo-oah
And you can play the guitar~
Oh-wo-ah-wo-ah-wo-oah
You can bang on the drums
Oh-wo-ah-wo-ah-wo-oah
Or you can sing like a star
And the mu~sic
Yeah, the mu~sic
Gets us to the top~
As we learn how the Rain~bow
Rainbow~ Rocks
As we learn how the Rain~bow
Rainbow~ Rocks
