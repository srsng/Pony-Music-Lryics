[00:02.98]OK, you know what you have to do, right?
[00:05.94]Beg for help, then quit when I get frustrated
[00:09.11]*glare*
[00:10.91]Just kidding! Total opposite of that, got it
[00:16.39]You think he can do it?
[00:18.10]Everypony has times in their lives
[00:20.98]When their hearts are filled with doubt
[00:23.76]Frustration builds up inside
[00:26.55]And it makes you wanna shout
[00:29.46]Bu-ut if you just take that first step
[00:32.20]The next one wi-ill appear
[00:35.03]And you find you can walk, then run
[00:38.20]Then fly-y-y
[00:43.26]Into the stratosphere
[00:49.30]You've got to give it your best
[00:51.82]So you can pass the test
[00:54.87]Give it everything that yo-u've go-ot
[01:00.27]And we know you can win
[01:02.62]You just have to begin
[01:05.62]Have to give it your very best sho-ot
[01:12.43]There are times when you wa-ant to give up
[01:16.08]When you think that you can't go-o o-on
[01:22.89]But if you fight through with all of your might
[01:26.92]You will find that you can't go wrong
[01:32.27]That you could do it all along
[01:36.38]Everypony has ti-imes in their lives
[01:39.21]When their hearts are filled with doubt
[01:42.04]But if you just give it yo-ur all
[01:44.78]You'll start to work it out
[01:47.70]And I know I can't give up too soon
[01:50.52]Get myself in the zone
[01:53.31]And I find I can walk, then run
[01:56.48]Then fly-y-y
[02:01.45]I can do it on my own-ah
[02:06.85]You can do it on your o-own
[02:12.25]I can do it on my own
[02:17.65]I can do it on my own
[02:21.42]I did it!
[02:22.32]I actually finished something
[02:23.99]By myself!
