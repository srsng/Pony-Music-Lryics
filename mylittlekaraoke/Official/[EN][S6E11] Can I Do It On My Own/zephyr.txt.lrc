Beg for help, then quit when I get frustrated
Just kidding! Total opposite of that, got it
Frustration builds up inside
And it makes you wanna shout
There are times when you wa-ant to give up
When you think that you can't go-o o-on
And I know I can't give up too soon
Get myself in the zone
And I find I can walk, then run
Then fly-y-y
I can do it on my own-ah
I can do it on my own
I can do it on my own
I did it!
I actually finished something
By myself!
