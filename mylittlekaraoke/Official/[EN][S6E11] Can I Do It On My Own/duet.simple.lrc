[00:02.94][P1] OK, you know what you have to do, right?
[00:05.89][P2] Beg for help, then quit when I get frustrated
[00:09.06][P1] *glare*
[00:10.86][P2] Just kidding! Total opposite of that, got it
[00:16.35][P1] You think he can do it?
[00:18.06][P1] Everypony has times in their lives
[00:20.93][P1] When their hearts are filled with doubt
[00:23.72][P2] Frustration builds up inside
[00:26.50][P2] And it makes you wanna shout
[00:29.42][P1] Bu-ut if you just take that first step
[00:32.16][P1] The next one wi-ill appear
[00:34.99][P1] And you find you can walk, then run
[00:38.16][P1] Then fly-y-y
[00:43.21][P1] Into the stratosphere
[00:49.25][P1] You've got to give it your best
[00:51.78][P1] So you can pass the test
[00:54.82][P1] Give it everything that yo-u've go-ot
[01:00.22][P1] And we know you can win
[01:02.58][P1] You just have to begin
[01:05.58][P1] Have to give it your very best sho-ot
[01:12.39][P2] There are times when you wa-ant to give up
[01:16.03][P2] When you think that you can't go-o o-on
[01:22.85][P1] But if you fight through with all of your might
[01:26.87][P1] You will find that you can't go wrong
[01:32.23][P1] That you could do it all along
[01:36.34][P1] Everypony has ti-imes in their lives
[01:39.17][P1] When their hearts are filled with doubt
[01:42.00][P1] But if you just give it yo-ur all
[01:44.74][P1] You'll start to work it out
[01:47.65][P2] And I know I can't give up too soon
[01:50.48][P2] Get myself in the zone
[01:53.27][P2] And I find I can walk, then run
[01:56.44][P1] Then fly-y-y
[01:56.44][P2] Then fly-y-y
[02:01.41][P2] I can do it on my own-ah
[02:06.81][P1] You can do it on your o-own
[02:12.20][P2] I can do it on my own
[02:17.60][P2] I can do it on my own
[02:21.37][P2] I did it!
[02:22.27][P2] I actually finished something
[02:23.94][P2] By myself!
