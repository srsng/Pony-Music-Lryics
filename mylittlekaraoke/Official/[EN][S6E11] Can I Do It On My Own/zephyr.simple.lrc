[00:05.89]Beg for help, then quit when I get frustrated
[00:10.86]Just kidding! Total opposite of that, got it
[00:23.72]Frustration builds up inside
[00:26.50]And it makes you wanna shout
[01:12.39]There are times when you wa-ant to give up
[01:16.03]When you think that you can't go-o o-on
[01:47.65]And I know I can't give up too soon
[01:50.48]Get myself in the zone
[01:53.27]And I find I can walk, then run
[01:56.44]Then fly-y-y
[02:01.41]I can do it on my own-ah
[02:12.20]I can do it on my own
[02:17.60]I can do it on my own
[02:21.37]I did it!
[02:22.27]I actually finished something
[02:23.94]By myself!
