[00:01.21]I have waited for the da-ay
[00:04.25]To send this greedy wolf awa-ay
[00:07.74]Now the magic is my salvation
[00:11.07]Gather close in my protection
[00:13.89]We will stand for Everfree
[00:24.24]Behold the beauty of nature in all its glo-ory
[00:30.57]No need to fe-ar the vultures at the door
[00:37.06]Right here you have me to protect you
[00:40.77]Within these walls of thorns
[00:43.40]For Everfree, forever more
[00:49.81]They have come into our doma-in
[00:53.00]Here to seal our camp in cha-ins
[00:56.04]But we have held it for generations
[00:59.37]This is just a complication
[01:02.15]We will stand for Everfree
[01:12.54]Trust in me, this is for your own good
[01:16.62]Don't be afraid, nature is our friend
[01:25.36]All of this beauty that surrounds us
[01:29.41]Every lovely bloom designed to defend
[01:37.74]Let them come, just let them try-y
[01:40.81]I'm not about to say goodbye-e
[01:44.00]This camp will be here throughout the a-ages
[01:47.37]Written into the history pages
[01:50.22]We will stand for E-eve-erfree
