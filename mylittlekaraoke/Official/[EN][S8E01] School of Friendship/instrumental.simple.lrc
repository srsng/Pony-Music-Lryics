[00:03.30]The School of Friendship, first day of class
[00:06.64]Will we fa-il or will we pass?
[00:09.83]Students come from far and wide
[00:13.13]Brand-ne-ew friends here by our side
[00:20.18]Take a breath, look around, it's amazing
[00:23.03]I can't believe that it's real
[00:26.03]Students galore, new ideas to explore
[00:28.88]Can't contain the excitement I feel
[00:34.54]Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now
[00:37.77]Think "success", keep it firmly in sight
[00:40.69]Make sure to do things by the book
[00:43.88]Make sure to do it all right
[01:01.69]The School of Friendship, must get to class
[01:04.99]Will we fa-il or will we pass?
[01:08.22]Students learning from the best
[01:11.48]Taking notes to pass the test
[01:15.12]Wait, hold on! Not like that! Just a second!
[01:18.34]I'm not sure if that method's approved
[01:21.15]Let me take a look! Yup, right here in the book
[01:24.38]Come on! We just got in the groove!
[01:28.05]Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now
[01:31.32]We are shaping young minds to ignite
[01:34.17]Do it like it says in the book now
[01:37.39]Make sure you're doing it right
[01:39.68]There's not an equation on how to have fun
[01:42.87]The students look bored now, oh, what have I done?
[01:45.83]Can't teach bein' honest, not sure what to do
[01:49.13]I'm quite certain I'm lost
[01:50.74]None of us has a clue!
[01:52.28]School of Friendship, another class
[01:55.20]Wish it we-re more of a blast
[01:58.50]Thought this school would be more fun
[02:01.73]Can't wait for our classes to be done
[02:05.37]Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now
[02:08.63]No way to have fun
[02:10.20]Oh, what have I done?
[02:11.85]Think "success", keep it firmly in sight
[02:14.70]Wish that we could leave our desks
[02:18.08]Listen to this one request
[02:21.12]Make things fun, we're really stressed
[02:24.60]Make sure to do things by the book now
[02:30.08]Can we tell her this thing is a mess?
