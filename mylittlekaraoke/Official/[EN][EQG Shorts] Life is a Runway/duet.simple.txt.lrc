Life is a runway
Listen, here's what it's all about
I tell you life is a runway
Time to bring what's on the inside out
Into the light
Into the light
Life is a runway
When you see it my way
Take all the good inside
Make it beautiful
Fashion is a way to start
Showing what's in your heart
Call it superficial
I call it irrefutable
Oh oh, ohwoahoh
Oh oh, ohwoahoh
Oh oh, ohwoahoh
Life is a runway
You can be the girl that you wanna be
With a little love and some accessories
Don't be scared to show you have personal style
Just go do your thing, you'll make everyone smile
