I have to find a way
To make this all o-okay
I can't believe this small mi-istake
Could have caused so much he-artache
Oh why, oh why-e-y-e-y?
Something is wrong, it's plain to see
This isn't how it's meant to-o be
And you can't see it like I do
It's not the life that's meant fo-or you
Oh why, oh why-e-y-e-y?
Losing pro-omise
I don't kno-ow what to do
Seeking answers
I fear I-I won't get through
To-o you
I'll try
I'm gonna try-e-y-e-y
I'll try
I'm gonna try-e-y-e-y
