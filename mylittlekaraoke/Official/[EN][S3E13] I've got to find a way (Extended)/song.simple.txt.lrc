I have to find a way
To make this all okay
I can't believe this small mistake
Could have caused so much heartache
Oh why, oh whyeyey?
Something is wrong, it's plain to see
This isn't how it's meant to be
And you can't see it like I do
It's not the life that's meant for you
Oh why, oh whyeyey?
Losing promise
I don't know what to do
Seeking answers
I fear I won't get through
To you
I'll try
I'm gonna tryeyey
I'll try
I'm gonna tryeyey
