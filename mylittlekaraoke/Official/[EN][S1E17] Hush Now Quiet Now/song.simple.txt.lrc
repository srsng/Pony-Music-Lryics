Hush now, quiet now, it's time to lay your sleepy head
Hush now, quiet now, it's time to go to bed
Hush now, quiet now! This is time to lay your sleepy head
Said, hush now, quiet now  This is time to go to bed
Drifting off to sleep the exciting day behind you
Drifting off to sleep, let the joy of dreamland find you
Hush now, quiet now, lay your sleepy head
Said hush now, quiet now, it's time to go to bed
Aaoow!
