[00:01.00]I know the world can get you down
[00:05.05]Things don't work out quite the way that you tho-o-ought
[00:09.32]Feeling like all your best days a-are done
[00:12.66]Your fears and doubts are all you've got
[00:16.22]But there's a li-ight shining deep inside
[00:20.35]Beneath those fears and doubts, so just squash 'em
[00:24.36]And let it shine for all the world to see
[00:28.45]That it is time, yeah, time to be awesome
[00:31.60]Ah, ah-ah, awesome
[00:33.25]It's time to be so awesome
[00:35.27]Ah ah, ah-ah, awesome
[00:37.30]It's time to be so awesome
[00:39.58]You've no idea how hard it's been
[00:43.71]This dull routi-ine we've been fo-orced to do-o
[00:47.76]Don't let them ro-ob you of who you are
[00:51.28]Be awesome, it's all up to you
[00:54.81]I feel the li-ight stirring deep insi-ide
[00:58.90]It's like a tale sti-i-ill yet to be to-o-old
[01:02.95]And now it's time to break the shackles free
[01:07.07]And start living like the brave and the bold
[01:09.85]It's time to be awesome
[01:11.80]Let loose, be true, so awesome
[01:13.93]It's time to be awesome
[01:15.92]Go big, be you, so awesome
[01:17.95]We used to soar through the clouds in the skies
[01:21.77]Elaborate schemes we would love to devise
[01:25.86]We rescued our treasure and stored it away
[01:30.17]Sa-avi-ing those gemstones for a rainy day
[01:33.47]We see that li-ight filling up our ski-es
[01:37.52]So take the Storm King's orders and toss 'em
[01:41.57]'Cause it's the time to let our colors fly
[01:45.58]Hey, scallywags, it's time to be awesome
[01:49.93]Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
