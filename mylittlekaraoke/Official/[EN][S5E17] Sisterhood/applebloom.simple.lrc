[00:06.91]We all love our brothers
[00:09.91]And our fathers and mo-others
[00:12.35]We honor them like every fam'ly should
[00:18.16]But there's somethin' that's quite unique
[00:21.16]When my sister's there with me
[00:24.09]And we share that special bond of si-isterhood
[00:29.82]Sisterhood
[00:32.86]Is a special kind of friend
[00:35.86]Sisterhood
[00:38.82]Is a bond that never ends
[00:43.02]It's not always perfect
[00:45.12]You might fight or be misunderstood
[00:48.12]But together you'll always have si-isterhood
