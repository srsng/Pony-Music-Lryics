We all love our brothers
And our fathers and mothers
We honor them like every fam'ly should
But there's somethin' that's quite unique
When my sister's there with me
And we share that special bond of sisterhood
Sisterhood
Sisterhood
It's not always perfect
You might fight or be misunderstood
But together you'll always have sisterhood
Sisterhood
Sisterhood
Sisterhood
Sisterhoodah!
