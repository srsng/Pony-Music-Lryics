Hey, hey, listen
We've got a message for you
We're not all alike
But our friendship is true
Yeah, we're really different
But we still get along
So hey, hey, listen to our song
You may think you're in control
But we're here to prove you wrong
With the friendship in our music
With the power of our song
Gonna stomp our feet, clap our hands
With the magic of friendship
Gonna stop your evil plan
