Trot outside and you see the sunshine
Something's in the air today
Sky is clear and you're feeling so fine
Everything's gonna be AOkay
If you listen carefully
On every corner
There's a rhythm playing
Then it happens suddenly
The music takes you over and you
Find you've got the music
Got the music in you
Find you've got the music
Got the music in you
Oh oh
Everypony's sayin' you should
Learn to express your voice
But if talk doesn't seem like
It's the answer
Luckily you have a choice
When you find you've got the music
Got the music in you
Find you've got the music
Got the music in you
Got the music
Got the music in you
