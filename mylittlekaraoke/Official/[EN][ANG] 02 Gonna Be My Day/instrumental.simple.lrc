[00:03.69]Good morning, sun
[00:04.89]No time to chat, I gotta run
[00:06.99]'Cause I've got places to be
[00:10.20]So much to do
[00:11.39]Excited, yes, and nervous, too
[00:13.50]A change is starting with me
[00:16.70]I never worry 'bout upsetting carts
[00:18.95]Hardened hearts
[00:20.00]Or wonder, "Will I belong?"
[00:22.59]I've heard it enough
[00:24.25]I'm callin' their bluff
[00:25.84]I'll never get lost in the gre-e-ey
[00:29.09]There's something inside
[00:30.75]Burns bigger than pride
[00:32.34]Shines out of me, lighting the wa-ay
[00:35.74]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be my da-ay
[00:38.99]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna bе my da-ay
[00:42.24]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna bе my da-ay
[00:46.30]Gonna bе my da-ay
[00:49.15]Hey there, hello!
[00:50.34]The friends I make, the friends I know
[00:52.34]Today you answer my call
[00:55.65]Instead of hide, instead of staying stuck inside
[00:58.84]Instead of building your wall
[01:02.09]Come on and party with me, join the band, understand
[01:05.34]We'll all be singing this song
[01:07.99]I've heard it enough
[01:09.59]I'm calling their bluff
[01:11.24]I'll never get lost in the gre-e-ey
[01:14.49]Go big or go home
[01:16.14]Get real or get known
[01:17.74]Get ready and raring to sa-ay
[01:21.14]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be my da-ay
[01:24.34]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna bе my da-ay
[01:34.29]Everyone's afra-aid
[01:37.34]Always ju-udging, never bu-udging
[01:40.89]Ain't it ti-ime we ma-ade the team
[01:46.84]A dre-e-e-eam?
[01:48.74]O-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh
[01:51.54]Let's cross a new aisle
[01:53.44]Let's flash a new smile
[01:54.99]Let's sparkle right out of the grey~
[01:58.19]We'll open our eyes
[01:59.89]Sun startin' to rise
[02:01.49]And finally able to sa-ay
[02:04.89]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be my da-ay
[02:08.15]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna bе my da-ay
[02:11.40]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna bе my da-ay
[02:15.44]Gonna~ be my day~
[02:20.34]Oh~~~
[02:23.54]Gonna~ be my day~
[02:30.04]Gonna~ be my day~
