[00:01.10]What was it that you needed?
[00:02.64]A little glass of water please
[00:05.08]A fresh pressed hanky if I sneeze
[00:07.47]Some tea with honey from the bees
[00:09.88]Whenever you can brew it
[00:12.09]I'll get your tea
[00:13.21]And while I get a little rest
[00:15.50]A teeny tiny small request
[00:17.94]Some codfish oil for my chest
[00:20.30]Poured from a crystal cruet
[00:22.36]A crystal cruet?
[00:23.34]My goodness, I'm a nincompoop
[00:24.99]Because I fear I've got the croup
[00:26.60]I need a vat of pumpkin soup
[00:28.18]And scarves made out of zinnias
[00:29.86]Did I say zinnias? I meant silk
[00:31.44]Or something shiny of that ilk
[00:33.09]And then I'll need some nice warm milk
[00:34.62]And pastries from Abyssinia
[00:36.16]And since my stomach's feeling crummy
[00:37.81]Why not give my aching tummy
[00:39.31]Something soothing, something yummy
[00:40.77]Piled up with noodles?
[00:42.24]Add a slice of homemade rye
[00:43.51]With stacks of Swiss way up high
[00:45.09]Served with sides of sweet mince pie
[00:46.51]More basil; I need oodles!
[00:48.43]Anything else?
[00:49.59]I'll be grateful for your charity
[00:53.49]Until the bitter end
[00:56.52]Because I've heard that tenderness
[00:59.90]Is what you lend an ailing friend
[01:03.61]Tenderness, isn't that right, friend?
[01:06.16]Right, but...
[01:07.17]So, who's ready for my big reprise?
[01:10.21]I'd like that glass of water please
[01:11.75]Some magic spell to cure disease
[01:13.32]A firm "gesundhoof" when I sneeze
[01:14.86]A fresh bouquet of roses
[01:16.40]Some lozenges will soon appease
[01:18.01]My wheezing when I start to sneeze
[01:19.59]A wig to keep me from the breeze
[01:21.16]And blankets for my toes-es
[01:22.74]Take tweezers out from my valise
[01:24.27]And then massage my knobby knees
[01:25.66]A bowl of peas, some extra cheese
[01:27.12]A cuddle with a Pekingese
[01:28.44]A singing harp who's named Louise
[01:29.86]A goat on skis, a new trapeze
[01:31.32]And more and more and more and more of these
[01:35.82]And just because I oughta
[01:37.47]Make sure I'm drinking in the right
[01:40.47]Amount of fluids day and night
[01:42.42]I wish I may, I wish I might
[01:44.15]Have just one little thing
[01:45.61]Oh, would you please finally bring
[01:46.96]Me that tiny glass
[01:49.06]Of water
