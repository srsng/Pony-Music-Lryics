[00:31.61]Wake up in the mornin'
[00:33.11]And I pull the covers over my head
[00:36.79]He-ey-oh
[00:39.30]I gotta get it movin'
[00:41.03]But I'd rather stay he-ere instead
[00:44.52]He-he-e-ey
[00:48.04]My hair's a disaster, don't know what to do
[00:51.75]But I need to move faster to make it through
[00:55.88]This crazy morning has got me confu-used
[01:03.60]Everywhere that I go
[01:05.52]Everything that I do
[01:07.28]I can't shake these Monday blues
[01:10.24]'Cause so-ome days, I can't find the way
[01:14.14]Out o-of this haze, hope I'll be o-oka-a-ay
[01:18.79] Just can't seem to get it right
[01:20.59]A cloud is hanging o-over me
[01:24.00]He-e-ey
[01:26.44]I wish it was the weekend
[01:28.20]'Cause you know that's where I'd ra-ather be
[01:31.77]He-he-e-ey
[01:35.25]I wonder what thi-ngs won't go my wa-ay
[01:39.04]Or if I'll ever make it through the day
[01:43.09]I hope this feeling won't lead me astra-ay
[01:50.74]Everywhere that I go
[01:52.69]Everything that I do
[01:54.49]I can't shake these Monday blues
[01:57.38]'Cause so-ome days, I can't find the way
[02:01.35]Out o-of this haze, hope I'll be o-oka-a-ay
[02:06.98]Just when I feel like it might come crashing do-o-own
[02:14.33]I can count on my friends to help me
[02:17.78]Turn my mo-od aro-o-o-ound!
[02:24.23]Everywhere that I go
[02:25.91]With everything that I do
[02:27.87]I'll say goodbye to the Monday blues
[02:30.83]'Cause I-I've got my friends with me
[02:34.77]And the su-unshi-ine is all I-I se-e-e
[02:39.94]Everywhere that I go
[02:41.67]With everything that I do
[02:43.62]The world feels so fresh a-and new
[02:46.58]'Ca-use I-I've got my friends with me
[02:50.52]And those blues are ancient histo-ory-y-y!
