Wake up in the mornin'
And I pull the covers over my head
Heyoh
I gotta get it movin'
But I'd rather stay here instead
Hehey
My hair's a disaster, don't know what to do
But I need to move faster to make it through
This crazy morning has got me confused
Everywhere that I go
Everything that I do
I can't shake these Monday blues
'Cause some days, I can't find the way
Out of this haze, hope I'll be okay
Just can't seem to get it right
A cloud is hanging over me
Hey
I wish it was the weekend
'Cause you know that's where I'd rather be
Hehey
I wonder what things won't go my way
Or if I'll ever make it through the day
I hope this feeling won't lead me astray
Everywhere that I go
Everything that I do
I can't shake these Monday blues
'Cause some days, I can't find the way
Out of this haze, hope I'll be okay
Just when I feel like it might come crashing down
I can count on my friends to help me
Turn my mod around!
Everywhere that I go
With everything that I do
I'll say goodbye to the Monday blues
'Cause I've got my friends with me
And the sunshine is all I se
Everywhere that I go
With everything that I do
The world feels so fresh and new
'Cause I've got my friends with me
And those blues are ancient history!
