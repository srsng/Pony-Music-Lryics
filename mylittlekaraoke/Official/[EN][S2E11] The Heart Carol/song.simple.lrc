[00:05.92]The fire of friendship lives in our hearts
[00:10.00]As long as it burns we can not drift apart
[00:14.17]Though quarrels arise
[00:15.96]their numbers are few
[00:18.50]Laughter and singing
[00:19.96]will see us through
[00:24.00]We are a circle of pony~ friends
[00:27.92]A circle of friends
[00:29.92]we'll be to the very end
