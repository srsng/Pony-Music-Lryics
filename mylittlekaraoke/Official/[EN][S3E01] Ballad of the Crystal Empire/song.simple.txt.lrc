Princess Cadence needs our help
Her magic will not last forever
I think we can do it
But we need to work together
We have to get this right
Yes, we have to make them see
We can save the crystal ponies
With their history
It says that they liked jousting
They flew a flag of many hues
Made sweets with crystal berries
They had a petting zoo with tiny ewes
Oh we have to get this right
Yes, we have to make them see
We can save the crystal ponies
With their history
There was a crystal flugelhorn
That everypony liked to play
And the crystal kingdom anthem
Can you learn it in a day?
Oh we have to get this right
Yes, we have to make them see
We can save the crystal ponies
With their history
