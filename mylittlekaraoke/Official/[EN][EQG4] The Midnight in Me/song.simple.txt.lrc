It used to be so simple
It was a world I understood
I didn't know what I didn't know
And life semed pretty good
But now the darkness rises
From somewhere deep inside of me
Her power overtakes me
Can I keep this Midnight from getting free
If I can stay with the light
I know I'll be free
And I can start to be whole
I can start to be me
But instead I am struggling with all that I see
And these friends
Mustn't see the Midnight in me
The Midnight in me
They mustn't see the Midnight in me
