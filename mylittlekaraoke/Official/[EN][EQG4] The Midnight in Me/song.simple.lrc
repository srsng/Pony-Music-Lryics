[00:00.78]It used to be so simple
[00:03.48]It was a world I-I understood
[00:07.94]I didn't kno-ow what I didn't kno-ow
[00:11.06]And life se-emed pretty good
[00:15.22]But now the darkness ri-ises
[00:20.66]From somewhere deep insi-ide of me
[00:28.53]Her power overta-akes me
[00:33.78]Can I keep this Midnight from getting free
[00:40.01]If I can stay with the light
[00:43.04]I know I'll be-e free
[00:46.34]And I can start to be whole
[00:49.27]I can sta-a-art to be me-e
[00:53.02]But instead I am struggling with a-all that I see
[00:59.21]And these friends
[01:02.54]Mustn't see the Midnight in me
[01:09.63]The Midnight in me-e-e-e
[01:14.28]They mustn't see the Midnight in me
