It used to be so simple
It was a world I-I understood
I didn't kno-ow what I didn't kno-ow
And life se-emed pretty good
But now the darkness ri-ises
From somewhere deep insi-ide of me
Her power overta-akes me
Can I keep this Midnight from getting free
If I can stay with the light
I know I'll be-e free
And I can start to be whole
I can sta-a-art to be me-e
But instead I am struggling with a-all that I see
And these friends
Mustn't see the Midnight in me
The Midnight in me-e-e-e
They mustn't see the Midnight in me
