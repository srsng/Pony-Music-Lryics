[00:05.27]When I was just a filly
[00:07.27]I found it rather silly
[00:09.77]To see how many other ponies I could meet
[00:14.27]I had my books to read
[00:16.27]Didn't know that I would ever need
[00:18.52]Other ponies to make my life complete
[00:22.77]But there was one colt that I cared for
[00:25.85]I knew he would be there for me
[00:29.85]My Big Brother Best Friend Forever
[00:34.42]Like two peas in a pod
[00:36.67]We did everything together
[00:39.77]He taught me how to fly a kite
[00:44.35]We never had a single fight
[00:48.31]We shared our hopes, we shared our dreams
[00:53.35]I miss him more than I realized
[00:57.06] I-it seems
[00:59.31]Your Big Brother Best Friend Forever
[01:03.77]Like two peas in a pod
[01:06.13]You did everything together
[01:09.20]And though he's oh so far away
[01:12.06]I hope that he would stay
[01:15.45]My Big Brother Best Friend
[01:19.70]Forever
[01:24.24]Foreve-e-e-er
[01:34.27]He was my Big Brother Best Friend
[01:39.17] Forever
[01:43.92]And now we'll never do anything
[01:48.52]Together
