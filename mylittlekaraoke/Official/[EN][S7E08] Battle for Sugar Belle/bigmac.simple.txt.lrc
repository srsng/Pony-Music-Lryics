We'll take a walk down by the river
Watch the sunset from the field
We'll plant the seeds of love together
And water 'em right for a really good yield
Sugar Belle, sweet as pie
You're the apple of my eye
A cherry blossom in a field of rye
And when the heifer's milked and fed
And the pigs are in the sty
Won't you be there by my side?
Sugar Belle, when I look in your eyes
*cough* I see the color... blue
And it reminds me of the sky above
Uh, which is also blue
I've been writin' this song for you
Searchin' for the perfect rhyme
For the words I wanna say
Somethin', summ summ summ..., Be mine
Sugar Belle!
Roses are red and violets are blue!
Sugar Belle!
Sugar Belle!
Sugar Belle!
...Bell...
