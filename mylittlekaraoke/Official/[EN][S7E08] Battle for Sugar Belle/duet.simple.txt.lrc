We'll take a walk down by the river
Watch the sunset from the field
We'll plant the seeds of love together
And water 'em right for a really good yield
Sugar Belle, sweet as pie
You're the apple of my eye
A cherry blossom in a field of rye
And when the heifer's milked and fed
And the pigs are in the sty
Won't you be there by my side?
Sugar Belle, when I look in your eyes
*cough* I see the color... blue
And it reminds me of the sky above
Uh, which is also blue
I've been writin' this song for you
Searchin' for the perfect rhyme
For the words I wanna say
Somethin', summ summ summ..., Be mine
Sugar Belle!
Roses are red and violets are blue!
Sugar Belle!
Sugar Belle!
Sugar Belle!
...Bell...
Ow, ow
Owah ow
When you appeared
Before me, my heart stopped beating
Stars crossed the sky
To come see what I was seeing
You were the one
That made me believe I could fly
Whoaoh whoaoh whoaoh
Birds could not sing
A song that's as beautiful
I'd do anything
That's irrefutable
'Cause you are the sun
Painting my heart in the sky
Sugar, Sugar Belle, whaoh
When will you tell me that you feel the same?
Like an angel on a candy cane
Or the sunlight shining through a drain
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Be my sugarplum
I will be your watermelon
Every time you smile
I can feel my heart aswellin'
Blood is rushin' from my head to my hoves, yeah
I start movin' when I'm feeling that grove, yeah
Every day I see you
I know you could be the one for me
Feel my heart abeating like
The rain upon a bumblebee
Don't you see that I could, uhoh, uhoh
Whenever you are near me, I'm so... uhoh
Sugar, Sugar! Ha hah...
My love is burning hot like a cheese fondue!
Sugar Belle!
Sugar Belle!
Sugar Belle!
Sugar Bell...
