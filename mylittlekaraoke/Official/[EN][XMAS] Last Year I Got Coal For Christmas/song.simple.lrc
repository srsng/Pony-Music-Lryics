[00:00.31]Last year I got coal for Christmas
[00:05.20]I got put on Santa's naughty list (Again!)
[00:10.18]Put a frog inside my teacher's desk - yeah, that was bad
[00:14.69]But this year, I made sure I won't get missed
[00:19.90]Last year I got coal for Christmas (Man!)
[00:24.84]Didn't do my homework for a week (Okay, a month!)
[00:29.42]But now I studied hard and nearly aced most every test
[00:34.24]So this year's Christmas better be the best
[00:39.76]Spent time with my old granny
[00:42.25]Raking up her lawn
[00:44.70]Took out the garbage every night (Ewww!)
[00:49.56]Helped mama do the laundry
[00:52.08]Cleaned up my room
[00:54.49]Did every single chore in sight
[00:59.08]Last year I got coal for Christmas (Aw, shucks!)
[01:03.98]Every photo I just made a face
[01:08.84]This year when we posed, I smiled sweetly like an angel
[01:13.74]No more taking chances just in case
[01:18.67]Last year I got coal for Christmas (Really?!)
[01:23.03]Ate dessert before my dinner most of the time (Mmm! Cake!)
[01:28.20]But this year I had vegetables with every single byte
[01:32.98]I sure hope this year Santa gets it right (Come on, Santa!)
[01:38.50]Spent time with my old granny
[01:41.02]Raking up her lawn
[01:43.43]Took out the garbage every night (She eats so much!)
[01:48.33]Helped mama do the laundry
[01:50.82]Cleaned up my room
[01:53.27]Did every single chore in sight (Aw, gross!)
[01:57.86]Last year I got coal for Christmas (For crying out loud!)
[02:02.48]I go to bed and never brush my teeth
[02:07.65]Now I bring my toothbrush each and every place I go
[02:12.20]So that tree better got my presents underneath
[02:17.49]This year, no more coal for Christmas (Yes!)
[02:22.35]Santa took me off the naughty list (Woo-hoo!)
[02:27.24]I might keep it up because it's really not so bad
[02:31.79]So Santa, just bring presents
[02:34.01]Please, dear Santa, no more lessons
[02:36.46]Next year, Santa, just bring presents, I insist!
[02:40.34]Seriously.
