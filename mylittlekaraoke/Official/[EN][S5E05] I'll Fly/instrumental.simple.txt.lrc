When life gives you lemons
You can make lemonade
But life gave me Tank here
And my choice has long been made
No winter will come to Ponyville
I'll do it on my own
I will keep you by my side
So I will not be alone
And I'll fly
And I'll fly until the end of the sky
So I'll be the one
Who doesn't have to say goodbye
I'll clear the skies forever
So we won't be apart
I'll keep the weather warm for you
And the winter will never start
Weathermakers, pegasi
Who make the seasons in the sky
I don't wanna sabotage you
But you see I've got to try
No winter can come here now
I'll keep the warmth and the sun somehow
I'm sorry, ponies, this has to be
For I need my friend and he needs me
I know it's wrong but what doesn't matter
'Cause nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll change it all, it's only the weather
And nopony's gonna bring me down
I'll keep the sunlight shining fre
And I'll bust the clouds apart
So you can stay with me
And I'll fly
And I'll fly until the end of the sky
So I'll be the one
Who doesn't have to say goodbye
I'll clear the skies forever
So we won't be apart
I'll keep the weather warm for you
And the winter will never start
