Time for the spectacle
Time for the sho-ow
The lights are bright and the colors glo-ow
I'm not just anypony
I think you kno-ow
The time is now, it's about to blo-o-o-o-o-ow!
Razzle dazzle
Glitz and gla-am
Turn it all up, it's a spectacl-l-le
Razzle dazzle
Glitz and gla-am
Turn it all up, it's a spectacle
Give me mo-ore
Razzle dazzle
Glitter eyes, big surprise
Lights, cameras
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah ah ah a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah
Razzle dazzle
Glitz and gla-am
Turn it all up, it's a spectacl-l-le
Hear the applause
Here to impress
Not just a pony, I am the Countess!
