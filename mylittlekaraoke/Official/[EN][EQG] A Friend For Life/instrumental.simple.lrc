[00:00.05]A friend for life
[00:02.42]That's what you are to me
[00:06.87]A friend fo-or li-ife
[00:09.29]That's what you are to me
[00:14.23]I couldn't see what was
[00:15.73]Right there in front of me
[00:17.40]Turned my back, got my mind off track, yeah
[00:21.10]You saw a world
[00:22.17]That was something new entirely
[00:24.48]Helped me to see
[00:25.66]All the possibiliti-ies
[00:28.40]Oh, like a star in the daylight
[00:31.84]Or like a diamond at night
[00:36.08]Your light was hidden
[00:38.01]Fro-om my si-i-ight
[00:41.23]A friend for life
[00:43.60]That's what you are to me
[00:48.11]A friend fo-or li-ife
[00:50.42]That's what you are to me
[00:55.62]Every friendship is tested
[00:58.31]You say sincere
[00:59.87]But it's all unclear now
[01:02.23]But with a word
[01:03.73]Everything changes
[01:05.29]And just like that
[01:07.11]You and I are right back
[01:09.53]Oh, like a star in the daylight
[01:13.02]Or like a diamond at night
[01:17.21]The light will shine
[01:19.20]When the time is right
[01:22.36]A friend for life
[01:24.73]That's what you are to me
[01:29.18]A friend for li-ife
[01:31.60]That's what you are to me
[01:36.75]When I put my hand out
[01:39.38]And I thought I would fall
[01:43.36]You knew what I needed
[01:46.15]And you came around
[01:47.87]To fix it all
[01:49.85]A friend for life
[01:52.11]That's what you are to me
[01:56.62]A friend for li-ife
[01:58.98]That's what you are to me
[02:03.55]A friend for li-ife
[02:05.91]That's what you are to me
[02:08.06]Oh-wu-oh
[02:10.36]A friend for li-ife
[02:12.73]That's what you are to me-e-e
[02:19.60]That's what you are to me
