[00:00.28]So you ha-ave ma-agic
[00:02.30]And it's not that great
[00:04.85]But when it fo-o-und you
[00:07.33]You know it was fa-ate
[00:09.58]And it might se-em scary now
[00:12.17]But it can be wonderful, too
[00:14.83]So how 'bout we embrace the magi-i-ic
[00:18.47]And make the magic part of you
[00:24.17]You take a little dash of magic
[00:26.72]And you let it ignite
[00:29.08]Mix things up a little bit
[00:31.33]And it might start to go-o right
[00:33.92]In just five seconds flat
[00:36.24]How the story ha-as changed
[00:38.68]All 'cause now you've embraced the magic
[00:42.02]And it just got better in every way
[00:47.98]I say embrace the magic
[00:52.74]No more holding back, just le-et it out
[00:57.58]If you can ta-ake the ma-agic
[01:02.34]And learn a little more wha-at it can do
[01:06.28]Once the magic is part of yo-u
[01:10.74]What's standing in your way
[01:13.14]That you can't move today?
[01:15.50]You've got the strength in you
[01:17.90]To make your dreams co-ome true
[01:20.34]No need to shield yourself
[01:22.70]From the magic that can help
[01:25.14]Protect from any harm that might come
[01:29.00]So you have magic
[01:31.14]And it's not that great
[01:33.65]But when it fo-o-ound you
[01:36.09]You know it was fa-ate
[01:38.45]So, if you listen close
[01:41.04]You might make a new friend
[01:43.74]And together we can make i-it
[01:48.02]I say embrace the magic
[01:52.74]No more holding back, just let it out
[01:57.62]If you can ta-ake the ma-a-agic
[02:02.45]And learn a little more wha-at it can do-o-o-o
[02:06.54]Once the magic is part of yo-o-o-o-o-u
[02:11.30]Once the magic is part of yo-o-o-o-u
[02:15.92]Once the magic is part of yo-o-o-o-o-o-o-u
[02:20.94]Once the magic is pa-art of you
