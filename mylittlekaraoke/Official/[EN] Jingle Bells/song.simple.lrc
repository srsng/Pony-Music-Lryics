[00:00.37]One! Two! One, two, three, four!
[00:02.88]Dashing through the snow
[00:05.13]In a one-horse open sleigh
[00:07.98]Over the fields we go
[00:10.45]Laughing all the way
[00:13.08]Bells on bob tail ring
[00:15.52]Making spirits bright
[00:17.80]What fun it is to fly and sing
[00:20.28]A sleighing song tonight
[00:22.53]Oh, jingle bells
[00:24.40]Jingle bells
[00:25.64]Jingle all the way
[00:28.15]Oh, what fun it is to fly
[00:30.44]In a one-horse open sleigh
[00:33.25]Jingle bells
[00:34.49]Jingle bells
[00:35.77]Jingle all the way
[00:38.35]Oh, what fun it is to ride
[00:40.53]In a one-horse open sleigh
[00:43.30]Thought I'd grab some friends
[00:45.55]And take them for a ride
[00:48.33]Not so sure what's up
[00:50.58]As ponies run and hide
[00:53.17]Put Rarity in the back
[00:55.68]Right next to Pinkie Pie
[00:58.45]Better buckle up, my friends
[01:00.74]'Cause we're about to fly
[01:02.95]Oh, jingle bells
[01:04.83]Jingle bells
[01:06.03]Jingle all the way
[01:08.62]Oh, what fun it is to fly
[01:10.83]In a one-horse open sleigh
[01:13.64]Jingle bells
[01:14.92]Jingle bells
[01:16.15]Jingle all the way
[01:18.70]Oh, what fun it is to ride
[01:20.95]In a one-horse open sleigh
[01:23.80]Go grab Applejack
[01:25.98]Who's hiding in the barn
[01:28.83]Put her in the back
[01:31.04]And leave behind the farm
[01:33.82]Sky is clear and blue
[01:36.07]And the wind is at our tails
[01:38.95]Ponies, hold on tight because
[01:41.09]We're 'bout to tip the scales
[01:46.87]Tomorrow is Christmas morning
[01:51.85]Tomorrow is Christmas day
[01:54.37]And Santa's coming 'round the corner
[01:57.33]And he's bringin' presents
[01:59.43]'Cause he's been fillin' up that
[02:01.64]Fillin' up that Santa sleigh
[02:04.12]We start speeding up
[02:06.33]As colors start to show
[02:08.92]Streaming through our manes
[02:11.05]The higher up we go
[02:13.83]Even faster still
[02:15.97]Faces fearing doom
[02:17.95]What fun it is to fly and sing
[02:20.28]As we SONIC RAINBOOM!
[02:22.87] Jingle bells
[02:23.92]Jingle bells
[02:25.12]Jingle all the way
[02:27.52]Oh, what fun it is to fly
[02:29.50]In a one-horse open sleigh
[02:32.13]Jingle bells
[02:33.29]Jingle bells
[02:34.45]Jingle all the way
[02:36.78]Oh, what fun it is to ride
[02:38.80]In a one-horse open sleigh
