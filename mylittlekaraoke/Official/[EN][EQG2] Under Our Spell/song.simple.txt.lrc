Ohwhoaoh, ohwhoaoh
You didn't know that you fell
Ohwhoaoh, ohwhoaoh
Now that you're under our spell
Blindsided by the beat
Clapping your hands, stomping your feet
You didn't know that you fell
Ahohahoh
Now you've fallen under our spell
Ohoh
We've got the music
Makes you move it
Got the song that makes you lose it
We say "Jump!", you say "How high?"
Put your hands up to the sky
We've got the music
Makes you move it
Got the song that makes you lose it
We say "Jump!", you say "How high?"
Put your hands up to the sky
Ohwhoaoh, ohwhoaoh
You didn't know that you fell
Ohwhoaoh, ohwhoaoh
Now that you're under our spell
Listen to the sound of my voice
Ahoh, ahoh
Soon you'll find you don't have a choice
Ahoh
Captured in the web of my song
Ahoh, ahoh
Soon you'll all be singing along
We've got the music
Makes you move it
Got the song that makes you lose it
We say "Jump!", you say "How high?"
Put your hands up to the sky
We've got the music
Makes you move it
Got the song that makes you lose it
We say "Jump!", you say "How high?"
Put your hands up to the sky
Ohwhoaoh, ohwhoaoh
You didn't know that you fell
Ohwhoaoh, ohwhoaoh
Now that you're under our spell
Ohwhoaoh, ohwhoaoh
You didn't know that you fell
Ohwhoaoh, ohwhoaoh
Now that you're under our spell
