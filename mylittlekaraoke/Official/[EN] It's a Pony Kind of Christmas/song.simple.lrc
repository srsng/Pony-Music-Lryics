[00:03.39]In every color shade
[00:06.44]All around the world of Equestria
[00:09.68]It's Christmas time here today
[00:12.54]It's a pony kind of Christmas
[00:15.59]Its light never fades
[00:18.65]All around the world of Equestria
[00:22.03]Christmas is here to stay
[00:26.63]Christmas is a time of joy
[00:30.38]When the li-i-ight of friendship bu-urns bri-ight
[00:35.74]Takin' time for family
[00:39.45]To recall the past and do what's right
[00:44.61]And outside gentle snow is fa-alling
[00:48.65]Forest creatures keeping warm below
[00:53.72]And all throughout Equestria
[00:57.57]We feel the li-ight of friendship only-y grow

[01:05.83]Its light never fades
[01:08.75]All around the world of Equestria
[01:12.17]Christmas is here to stay
[01:16.68]Dashing through the snow
[01:19.03]In a one-horse open sleigh
[01:22.60]Over the fields we go-o
[01:25.55]Laughing all the way
[01:28.56]Decorate with boughs of holly
[01:31.52]Fill the halls with wonder
[01:34.48]Wrap the presents, silver paper
[01:37.43]Trim the tree and place them under
[01:40.44]Time for counting down the days to Christmas
[01:46.35]Every day that passes is a party we can throw
[01:52.27]Time for counting down the days to Christma-as
[01:57.86]And everyday our friendship grows
