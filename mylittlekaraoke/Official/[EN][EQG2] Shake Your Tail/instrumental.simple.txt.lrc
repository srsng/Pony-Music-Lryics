We've just got the day
To get ready
And there's only so much time to lose
Because tonight
Yeah, we're here to party
So let's think of something fun to do
We don't know what's gonna happen
We just know it's gonna feel right
All our friends are here
And it's time to ignite the lights!
Shake your tail
'cause we're here to have a party tonight
Shake your tail, shake your tail
Shake your tail
'cause we're here to have a party tonight
Shake your tail, shake your tail
So what, you didn't get it right the first time
Laugh it off, no one said it is a crime
Do your thing, you know you're an original
Your ideas are so funny that they're criminal
Ohah!
