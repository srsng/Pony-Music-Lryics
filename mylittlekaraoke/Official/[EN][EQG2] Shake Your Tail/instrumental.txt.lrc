We've just got the day
To get ready
And there's only so much time to lo-ose
Because tonight
Yeah, we're here to party
So let's think of something fun to do
We do-n't know what's gonna happen
We just know it's gonna feel right
All our friends are here
And it's time to igni-i-ite the li-i-ights!
Shake your tail
'cause we're here to have a party tonight
Shake your tail, shake your ta-a-ail
Shake your tail
'cause we're here to have a party tonight
Shake your tail, shake your ta-a-ail
So what, you didn't get it right the first time
Laugh it off, no one said it is a crime
Do your thing, you know you're an original
Your ideas are so funny that they're criminal
Oh-ah!
