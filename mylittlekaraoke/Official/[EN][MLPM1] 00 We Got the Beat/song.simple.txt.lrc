See the ponies trottin' down the street
Equestria is where they wanna meet
They all know where they wanna go
And they're trottin' in time
And they're trottin', yeah
They got the beat
They got the beat
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat
Gogo music really makes us dance
Do the pony, puts us in a trance
Do watusi, just give us a chance
That's when we fall in line
'Cause we got the beat
We got the beat
We got the beat
Yeah, we got it!
