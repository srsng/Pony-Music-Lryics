[00:07.03]Your heart is in two places, you can only live in one
[00:10.74]You're torn between the hilltops and the-e tide
[00:14.49]Thank goodness that the Cutie Mark Crusaders have begu-un
[00:19.26]To give you hope and help you to decide
[00:25.37]These hills, they call to you, they say "Harmonizing Heights"
[00:28.82]This is your home, simple and serene
[00:32.31]The sun-dappled leaves or a mountain terrace
[00:36.17]You can see twenty-three different shades of green
[00:39.47]To dare to compare anywhere to there
[00:44.91]Is unfair and just plain wrong
[00:48.66]Colt or mare or you wear
[00:50.49]Feathers, fins, or hair
[00:52.82]This is where you belong
[00:56.04]Well, on the other hoof,
[00:57.13]I can think of a place that's way more exciting and cool
[00:59.94]Not to mention more you!
[01:01.71]Come on, you know exactly where I mean!
[01:04.56]Seaquestria's the most, you're supposed to be there
[01:08.12]Underneath the sea, where you can feel at home
[01:12.17]Swimmin' with your friends, you can spend all day here
[01:15.43]Playin' in the bay here, splashin' in the foam
[01:19.59]Sailin' through the wavy blue
[01:23.91]You'll view a slew of tortoises
[01:26.72]Forget the rest, the sea's the-e best
[01:30.39]For all intents and porpoises
[01:34.33]Build your nest
[01:35.72]Here on Harmonizing Heights
[01:38.04]Live it up here in Seaquestria-a-a
[01:41.72]Nothing compares to Harmonizing Heights
[01:45.21]The eagles are regal
[01:47.04]The schools are cooler
[01:48.88]Their claws are so awesome
[01:50.49]With their sweet maneuvers
[01:52.82]Star wishes every night
[01:54.66]Starfish by e-el light
[01:56.49]Better
[01:57.47]Wetter
[01:58.37]Shinier
[01:59.23]Brinier
[01:59.94]Seaquestria
[02:00.84]Harmonizing Heights
[02:01.74]Seaquestria
[02:02.64]Harmonizing Heights
[02:03.84]That's it
[02:04.56]This is the end
[02:05.49]Don't ever talk to me again
