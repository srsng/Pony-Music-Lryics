[00:06.00]I thought Earth ponies were the pony ladder's bottom rung
[00:08.75]I heard that pegasi were brutes you'd hate to be among
[00:11.56]You smell like fishes (you're vicious)
[00:12.89]I bet you eat your young
[00:14.31]Meet any one of you, the thing to do is run away
[00:17.59]But although I know we're all a bunch of different breeds
[00:20.56]Take away~ our wings and horns and we're just frightened steeds
[00:23.28]So let's put aside our differences 'cause what we need's a win~
[00:27.46]Oh oh oh
[00:28.84]Come on, rip~ out all the pages of your history books
[00:31.64]Just because we're undercover doesn't mean we're crooks
[00:34.44]When we walk you through the crowd and give your brand new looks a spin
[00:39.27]You're gonna fit right in
[00:40.82]This is a new low
[00:42.03]You're gonna fit right in
[00:44.01]It's never gonna work
[00:46.21]They taught us unicorns were super scary maniacs
[00:48.97]With horns like razors and tongues like tasers and teeth like tacks
[00:51.77]They take your hooves and then they grind them into midnight snacks
[00:54.53]The basic gist of it is unicorns are not okay
[00:57.81]Look I know we're risking everything for this endeavor
[01:01.04]But look at us, we're brave and strong and weird and clever plus
[01:04.01]Closer to the finish than we've ever ever been
[01:07.68]Wow oh oh
[01:09.10]So, we better take a leap and put our faith in you
[01:11.86]Get our crafty on with sparkles, tape, and super glue
[01:14.62]'Cause we're running out of options and we're desperate to begin
[01:19.49]You're gonna fit right in
[01:21.00]Ha, if you say so
[01:22.25]You're gonna fit right in
[01:23.62]I know you will, now watch and learn
[01:26.21]This is how a unicorn walks
[01:28.24]Walks
[01:28.93]And this is how a unicorn talks
[01:31.00]Talks
[01:31.86]This is how a unicorn hoops
[01:33.71]Hoops
[01:34.53]This is how a unicorn
[01:35.95]Oops
[01:36.34]Oh, geez, stop!
[01:37.33]This is how a unicorn struts
[01:39.27]Struts
[01:39.79]Oh, watch you shake your unicorn butts
[01:42.03]Butts!
[01:42.89]Now you're in the unicorn know
[01:44.87]Woah
[01:45.65]Soon, you'll be a unicorn pro
[01:48.02]Oh, a unicorn horn makes a unicorn stride
[01:50.87]It's the more-head on your forehead
[01:52.33]It's the source of your pride
[01:53.67]Every unicorn who's born has worn a horn that's unique
[01:56.25]So I'll whip them up as we speak
[01:57.59]You'll be lookin' tr√®s magnifique
[01:59.06]We'll fake a pony protrusion
[02:00.48]To make a bony illusion
[02:01.86]It's not the perfect solution
[02:03.19]But the world's not big on inclusion
[02:04.62]And with those rocks in our pocket
[02:06.04]We'll reap the reward
[02:07.07]And folks will be floored
[02:08.06]We'll strike a new chord
[02:09.14]Our magic restored
[02:10.48]Lately all Equestria has lost its heart
[02:12.89]But if we can help to find it, we should play our part
[02:15.65]If we fail, we'll go to prison
[02:17.33]But if not, we'll start to grin~
[02:20.69]So, let's begin~
[02:23.32]We're gonna fit right in
[02:26.08]We're gonna fit right in
[02:28.88]We're gonna fit right in
[02:31.64]We're gonna fit right in
[02:35.69]This is how a unicorn walks
[02:38.41]This is how a unicorn talks
[02:41.17]Now you're looking unicorn strong~~~~
[02:44.01]This is how a unicorn ends this song
