I know,
Ponies just bursting into song at random places
At the drop of a hat
Who does that?
Oh, Manehattan
What you do to me
Such a huge bustling
Community
And there's always
Opportunity
To do the friendly thing
If some are grouchy
Pay no mind
Surprise instead
With something kind
Lo and behold
You may just find
A smile is what you bring
Welcome to the Mane Fair Hotel!
Please allow me to take those bags
To your room for ya!
Only if you'll accept this gratuity first
Ohoho! I'll get your change!
Do keep it all. I insist!
Generosity
I'm here to show all that
I can give
Generosity
I'm here to set the bar
Just sit back and watch
How I live
After you!
Why, thank you
Please, take mine!
Wow, okay
Some may say,
"Rarity
Don't be so bighearted and bold
Treating strangers like they're friends
This town's too big and cold"
But this is how I play my cards
I'm not about to fold
Where I see a frown
I go to town
Call me the Smile Patrol
Oh, Manehattan
What you do to us
What if you find a Gloomy Gus?
It's no intimidatin' thing
Just be kind without a fuss
Generosity
I'm here to show all
That I can do
Generosity
You are the key
Manehattan
I'm here just for you
Just for you
Oh, Manehattan
What have I done?
The thought of Fashion Week was fun
But I went way too far
My friends gave to me
In ways so kind
And I gave them nothing
But a hard time
And now alone I stand
And now alone I stand
