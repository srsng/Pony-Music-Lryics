[00:00.00]Oh, girls! Don't you see?!
[00:03.02]When I was a little filly
[00:04.81]And the sun was going do-o-o-own
[00:08.66]Tell me she's not...
[00:09.49]The darkness and the shadows
[00:11.34]They would always make me fro-o-o-own
[00:15.13]She is...
[00:16.09]I'd hide under my pillow,
[00:18.22]From what I thought I saw
[00:20.43]But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way
[00:22.56]To deal with fears at all!
[00:24.83]Then what is?
[00:25.52]She said: "Pinkie you gotta stand up tall
[00:28.82]Learn to face your fears
[00:30.54]You'll see, that they can't hurt you
[00:32.40]Just laugh to make them disappear!"
[00:35.91]Ha! Ha! Ha!
[00:39.83]So, giggle at the ghostly
[00:43.20]Guffaw at the grossly
[00:45.40]Crack up at the creepy
[00:47.60]Whoop it up with the weepy-y-y
[00:49.74]Chortle at the kooky
[00:51.87]Snortle at the spooky
[00:53.87]And tell that big dumb scary face
[00:55.10]To take a hike and leave you alone
[00:56.21]And if he thinks he can scare you
[00:57.24]Then he's got another thing coming
[00:58.41] and the very idea of such a thing
[00:59.65] just makes you wanna
[01:03.16]Laugh!
