[00:01.21]I never claimed to be perfect
[00:03.29]My mistakes are all written in ink
[00:06.33]None of us claimed to be perfect
[00:08.66]And it's sad if that's what you all think
[00:11.32]Our flaws helped to make us special
[00:14.02]They bond us and keep us strong
[00:16.65]Our flaws are what brought us together
[00:19.18]So stop actin' like something's wro-o-o-ong
[00:22.34]We're not flawless
[00:25.26]We're work in progress
[00:26.96]We've got dents and we've got quirks
[00:29.50]But it's our flaws that make us work
[00:32.24]Yeah, we're not flawle-ess
[00:35.94]We're work in progress
[00:37.65]So tell me what flaws you got, to-o
[00:40.81]'Cause I still like what's flawed about you
[00:43.97]They say I'm a big shot
[00:45.89]That my ego's the size of a whale
[00:48.76]My confidence comes off as cocky
[00:51.29]But it gives me the courage to fail
[00:53.96]Sure, I can be a drama queen
[00:56.87]A bit stuck-up, it's true
[00:59.36]And I can be too eager to please
[01:02.11]There's such thing as bein' too honest, too, 'cause
[01:05.02]We're not flawless
[01:07.93]We're work in progress
[01:09.64]We've got dents and we've got quirks
[01:12.17]But it's our flaws that make us work
[01:14.92]Yeah, we're not flawle-ess
[01:18.66]We're work in progress
[01:20.28]So tell me what flaws you got, to-o
[01:23.45]'Cause I still like what's flawed about you
[01:26.61]Ponies think I'm all bubbles and laughter
[01:29.31]That I don't seem sincere
[01:31.18]I might joke around a little too much-uch
[01:33.64]But I'm just so happy yo-u're here
[01:36.67]It took me a while to be confident
[01:39.42]To really come out of my shell
[01:42.04]But no-opony has to be-e perfect
[01:44.62]By now, don't you know us so well?
[01:46.70]Because, yeah
[01:47.69]We're not flawless
[01:50.65]We're work in progress
[01:52.31]We've got dents and we've got quirks
[01:54.81]But it's our flaws that make us work
[01:57.55]Yeah, we're not flawle-ess
[02:01.25]We're work in progress
[02:02.96]So tell me what flaws you got, to-o
[02:06.16]'Cause I still like what's flawed about you
