[00:02.33]What is this place filled with so many wonders?
[00:06.83]Casting its spell that I am now under
[00:11.42]Squirrels in the trees and the cute little bunnies
[00:16.00]Birds flying free and bees with their honey
[00:20.75]Honey!
[00:26.92]Oh, what a magical place
[00:29.50]And I owe it all to the Pegasus race
[00:32.58]If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve
[00:35.67]I'd have come here sooner, and never leave
[00:38.75]Yes, I love everything!
