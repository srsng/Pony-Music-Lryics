What is this place filled with so many wonders?
Casting its spell that I am now under
Squirrels in the trees and the cute little bunnies
Birds flying free and bees with their honey
Honey!
Oh, what a magical place
And I owe it all to the Pegasus race
If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve
I'd have come here sooner, and never leave
Yes, I love everything!
