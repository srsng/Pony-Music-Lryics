[00:08.97]Each one of us has something special
[00:12.01]That makes us different
[00:13.88]That makes u-us rare
[00:16.55]We have a light that shines within us
[00:19.55]That we were always
[00:21.38]Meant to sha-a-are
[00:24.23]And when we come together
[00:26.11]Combine the light that shines within
[00:28.21]There is nothing we can't do
[00:29.86]There is no battle we can't win
[00:31.96]When we come together
[00:33.57]There'll be a star to guide the way
[00:35.67]It's inside us every day
[00:38.30]See it now, see it now
[00:42.23]Let the rainbo-ow remind you
[00:45.98]That together we will always shine
[00:49.73]Let the rainbo-ow remind yo-u
[00:53.52]That forever this will be our ti-ime
[01:04.77]Let the rainbo-ow remind you
[01:08.56]That together we will always shine
