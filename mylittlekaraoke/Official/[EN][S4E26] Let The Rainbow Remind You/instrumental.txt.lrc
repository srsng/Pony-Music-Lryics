Each one of us has something special
That makes us different
That makes u-us rare
We have a light that shines within us
That we were always
Meant to sha-a-are
And when we come together
Combine the light that shines within
There is nothing we can't do
There is no battle we can't win
When we come together
There'll be a star to guide the way
It's inside us every day
See it now, see it now
Let the rainbo-ow remind you
That together we will always shine
Let the rainbo-ow remind yo-u
That forever this will be our ti-ime
Let the rainbo-ow remind you
That together we will always shine
