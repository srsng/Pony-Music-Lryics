[00:09.80]We celebrate our friendship
[00:13.69]We celebrate the tree
[00:17.46]The memories~ inside~ us
[00:20.67]We'll build for all to see
[00:25.08]The tree brought us together
[00:28.93]And even though it's gone~
[00:32.74]Our monument of friendship
[00:35.83]Can make the gift live on
[00:39.32]A piece from me~
[00:41.27]A piece from you
[00:43.13]We'll use the tree and we'll~ make do
[00:46.98]If things don't fit~
[00:48.89]There's lots of glue
[00:50.99]Friends don't quit in the end
[00:52.97]And together we'll see this through
[00:55.59]It's hard to say farewell
[00:59.36]To something you hold dear~
[01:03.17]But goodbye isn't fore~ver
[01:06.31]As long as we are here
[01:11.07]The tree is in our memory~
[01:18.65]Its roots have grown deep in our hearts
[01:26.31]Its branches raise our spirits, together we're all bound
[01:33.89]Forever it stands
[01:37.14]Lost but now it's found
[01:42.22]So lift a beam~
[01:44.16]And build it strong
[01:46.03]Work as a team, it won't~ take long
[01:49.84]Hey Silverstream~
[01:51.70]I think that's wrong
[01:53.65]We'll live the dream and sing~ our song
[01:57.97]And make the tree something all can see
[02:01.55]In a place where we belong!
