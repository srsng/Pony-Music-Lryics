[00:10.13]Every single day
[00:11.38]There's something new
[00:12.52]You can plan for
[00:14.01]Every single day
[00:15.21]There's something wonderful to do
[00:17.60]But nothing makes me happy
[00:19.51]Like a day that I can say
[00:21.48]"Today I planned a party
[00:23.21]And it's just for you!"
[00:25.48]How's it going today, Pinkie?
[00:27.10]Great, thanks! Got any streamers today?
[00:29.60]You betcha! Big party planned?
[00:31.70]Don't you know it!
[00:33.13]Don't have much time to gather
[00:35.28]All the things I need
[00:36.95]If I'm really gonna make this party fly-y
[00:40.78]For today's another day
[00:42.27]That all of Ponyville will say
[00:44.72]There goes the Super Party Pony Pinkie Pie!

[00:51.23]Where we played all sorts of games
[00:53.62]Having so much fun as we chose
[00:55.59] Pound and Pumpkin's names
[00:57.26]She planned my CuteceaÃ±era
[00:59.05]My dad made me, I won't lie
[01:01.15]I demanded all the best
[01:02.94]I suppose she passed the test
[01:05.03]Sure it was pretty good
[01:06.52]All thanks to Pinkie Pie

[01:21.75]Every single day
[01:22.89]There's something new
[01:24.14] we can plan for
[01:25.58]Every single day
[01:26.83] there's something wonderful to try
[01:29.22]But nothing makes us happy
[01:31.13]Like a day that we can say
