[00:02.61]The Super Duper Party Pony
[00:04.40]That pony is me
[00:05.80]I always knew that was
[00:07.05]The kind of pony I would be
[00:09.64]Come on, ponies! Who here likes to party?
[00:12.34]Ha-ha! You do, I can tell!
[00:14.58]When I was but a little colt
[00:16.18] I just wanted to play
[00:17.82]But everypony told me
[00:19.12]"Cheese, that fun just wastes the day"
[00:21.02]But when I threw a party
[00:22.46]And I busted out some moves
[00:24.16]The ponies finally saw the light
[00:25.81]And got into the groove
[00:28.20]The Super Duper Party Pony
[00:30.00]That pony is me
[00:31.39]You'll never meet another
[00:32.79]Party pony quite like Cheese!
[00:35.14]Hey, good lookin', want some mayonnaise?
[00:36.98]My parties are all off the hook
[00:38.63]I never plan them by the book
[00:40.12]I start out fun, then whoopsie daisy
[00:41.97]Everybody just gets crazy!
[00:43.62]Bored of snacks made by your mom?
[00:45.21]How 'bout a giant party bomb?
[00:46.81]Huge piÃ±atas filled with cake
[00:48.21]Or dive into my fruit punch lake!
[00:51.35]The Super Duper Party Pony
[00:53.19]That pony is me
[00:54.59]You'll never meet another
[00:55.99]Party pony quite like Cheese
[00:59.73]C'mon, kid, take it for a spin!
[01:04.17]Oh, when I throw a Cheese party
[01:05.77]Be sure to not be lame
[01:07.41]And miss my pie fights, wacky kites
[01:09.01]And streamers in your mane
[01:10.75]Fizzy drinks, Hawaiian shirts
[01:12.20]And brie fondue delight
[01:13.80]You know that with Cheese Sandwich
