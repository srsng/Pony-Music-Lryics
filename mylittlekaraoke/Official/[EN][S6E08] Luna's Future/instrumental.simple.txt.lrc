I see a cold wind's blowing through
I see days neither fun nor free
I see a future caused by you
I see a path not meant to be
The future should be filled with magic
Dreams and wishes brought to life
But the days ahead are dark and tragic
No time for hope when all is strife
Whatever might have been
All the dreams that ponies share
Because of you, Snowfall Frost
Now the future is a cold nightmare
Windigoes?
They aren't real!
It's just a little fillies' story
They are all too real, Snowfall
And your actions will allow them to return
The future of Equestria shall be bathed
In a blanket of eternal snow
No! I never meant for this to happen
I didn't understand!
I didn't see how important Hearth's Warming Eve was
Please spirit, I haven't cast the spell yet
Is there still time?
I'm sorry!
