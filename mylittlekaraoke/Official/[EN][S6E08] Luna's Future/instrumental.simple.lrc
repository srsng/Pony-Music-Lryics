[00:04.38]I see a cold wind's blowing through
[00:11.59]I see days neither fun nor free
[00:17.82]I see a future caused by you
[00:24.43]I see a path not meant to be-e-e
[00:30.23]The future should be filled with magic
[00:36.51]Dreams and wishes brought to li-i-ife
[00:43.21]But the days ahead are dark and tragic
[00:50.28]No time for ho-ope when all is strife
[00:56.98]Whatever might have been
[01:00.25]All the dreams that po-onies share
[01:03.77]Because of you, Snowfall Frost
[01:06.95]Now the future is a cold nightma-are
[01:10.93]Windigoes?
[01:11.87]They aren't real!
[01:12.90]It's just a little fillies' story
[01:14.82]They are all too real, Snowfall
[01:17.02]And your actions will allow them to return
[01:20.07]The future of Equestria shall be bathed
[01:22.22]In a blanket of eternal snow
[01:24.84]No! I never meant for this to happen
[01:27.37]I didn't understand!
[01:28.87]I didn't see how important Hearth's Warming Eve was
[01:32.01]Please spirit, I haven't cast the spell yet
[01:35.15]Is there still time?
[01:36.65]I'm sorry!
