[00:01.20]Where is she going?
[00:02.44]Where do you think?
[00:03.75]C'mon, after her!
[00:05.33]Wait! I'm coming too!
[00:07.31]Cutie Mark Crusaders
[00:08.96]Get out of my-y wa-ay
[00:13.54]Those ponies need to know the truth
[00:15.26]And they'll hear it from me-e
[00:19.69]STOP!
[00:20.44]Diamond Tiara, this is not the way
[00:26.29]We know you're better than this hostility
[00:32.89]You don't even know me-e at a-all
[00:36.11]Don't understand the meaning of my fall
[00:39.26]What my family would think if I ever
[00:42.08]Fail at anything
[00:45.71]I'm a diamond that means you never break
[00:48.68]No matter what may the cost of the path I take
[00:51.98]Whatever I have to do
[00:53.70]To win in the end
[00:58.46]STOP!
[00:59.25]This is not the answer
[01:01.69]WAIT!
[01:02.48]And it's plainly seen
[01:04.46]LISTEN!
[01:05.44]You can't redeem yourself
[01:07.24]But by helping others, not by being mean
[01:11.29]We know you want friends who admire you
[01:14.44]You wanna be the star with all the power too
[01:17.48]But there's a better way
[01:19.31]There's a better wa-a-ay
[01:24.11]There's so much more still left to
[01:26.89]Learn about yourself
[01:29.25]See the light that shines in you
[01:32.25]We know you can be somepony else
[01:36.86]You can stop right now
[01:39.26]And try another start
[01:42.23]You'll finally free yourself from the dark
[01:45.41]And see the light
[01:47.06]And see the light of your cutie mark
[01:55.54]Everypony! I have an announcement.
