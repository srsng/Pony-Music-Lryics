[00:01.96]Heads high, ponies!
[00:03.67]Marching proud!
[00:05.62]All together now, every one of you!
[00:08.64]Nopony left behind!
[00:12.26]Life is so grand in our town
[00:15.10]We're always filled with cheer
[00:18.17]We never have to look around
[00:21.19]To know that we're all here
[00:24.10]In our town, in our town
[00:27.47]We don't have to wait
[00:30.15]To find out that our destiny
[00:33.33]Is just to emulate
[00:35.38]Let's see those big, happy smiles
[00:38.11]Life is a smile in our town
[00:40.87]Our Cutie Marks the same
[00:43.94]Because we do not separate
[00:46.96]Ourselves by more than name
[00:49.87]In our town, in our town
[00:53.27]We dare not compete
[00:56.34]Winning only breeds the worst
[00:59.44]Ego-filled conceit
[01:01.30]You see, now everypony wins
[01:05.45]Life is a joy in our town
[01:08.40]We're all equal here
[01:11.54]No-one is superior
[01:14.30]And no-one shakes in fear
[01:17.25]In our town, in our town
[01:20.61]We work as a team
[01:23.60]You can't have a nightmare
[01:26.63]If you never dream
[01:31.29]Other ponies argue
[01:33.87]Do you ever wonder why?
[01:36.86]When you think your talent's special
[01:40.15]You don't see eye to eye
[01:43.02]There's just too many differences
[01:46.16]That lead to disarray
[01:49.22]But when you learn to act as one
[01:52.25]It's like a holiday
[01:55.20]In our town, in our town
[01:58.60]We don't complicate
[02:01.62]When you learn to simplify
[02:04.65]Life is oh so great
[02:07.67]Join in our utopia
[02:10.73]Come out of the dark
[02:13.80]Banded by equality
[02:16.82]By our Cutie mark
