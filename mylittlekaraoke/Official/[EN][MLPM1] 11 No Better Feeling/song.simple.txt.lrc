You know that we light up the night
So nothing is black and white
'Cause e~verything I do
Is always technicolor wit' you
And I know~~~ that you got my back
Don't you know~~~ I got you like~ that
I could fly~~~~ when you're by my side
When you're by~ my side
Ain't no better feelin'~
Ain't no better feelin'~
Yeah, you're the reason~
I could feel the stars
Light up in my heart
Ain't no better feelin'~
You're the magic in the ga~laxy
Bringing out the best in me
Shining like a diamond sun
Is what you do for e~veryone
And I know~~~ that you got my back
Don't you know~~~ I got you like~ that
I could fly~~~~ when you're by my side
When you're by~ my side
Ain't no better feelin'~
Ain't no better feelin'~
Yeah, you're the reason~
I could feel the stars
Light up in my heart
Ain't no better feelin'~
Ain't no better feelin'~
Ain't no better feelin'~
Yeah, you're the reason~
I could feel the stars
Light up in my heart
Ain't no better feelin'~
Ain't no better feelin'~
Yeah, you're the reason~
I could feel the stars
Light up in my heart
Ain't no better feelin'~
