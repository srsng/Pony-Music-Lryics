There's music in the treetops
And there's music in the vale
And all around me music fills the sky
There's music by the river
And there's music in the grass
And the music makes your heart soar in reply
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
