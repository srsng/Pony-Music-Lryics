Somewhere's a bok
With chapters still blank inside
It's the book of our lives
And the story is ours to write
Some pages fade
While others are black and white
And the story begins
Again every time we try
And hope shines eternal
And friends are all I ned
And hope shines eternal
And the future is always bright
When you're here with me
I've fought through the darkness
And come out the other side
For rainclouds will clear
The way for the sunny sky
I've been afraid
And stayed through the longest night
But morning still comes
And with it, it brings a light
And hope shines eternal
And friends are all II ned
And hope shines eternal
And the future is always bright
The future is always bright
Yeah, the future is always bright
When you're here with me
...Inside
Ours to write
...And white
Everytime we try
And hope shines eternal
All I need
And hope
Shines eternal
And the future is always bright
When you're here with me
...Other side
Way for the sunny sky
Through the longest night
Oh, it brings the light
And hope shines eternal
Yeah, they're all I ned
And hope
Shines eternal
And the future is always bright
The future is always bright
Yeah, the future is always bright
When you're here with me
