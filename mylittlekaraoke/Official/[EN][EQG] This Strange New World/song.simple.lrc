[00:07.18]I've never seen a place
[00:09.04]That's quite like this
[00:11.20]Everything is turned around
[00:12.86]This crazy world is upside down
[00:15.06]Getting on my feet
[00:16.50]It's the hand that I was dealt
[00:18.55]But I don't have much time with them
[00:20.71]Got to learn all that I can
[00:29.99]They don't use any magic
[00:31.88]Or fly with any wings
[00:34.04]I don't get these funny clothes
[00:35.94]Skinny legs or tiny nose
[00:37.91]Everything's confusing
[00:39.31]When it seems so~ new
[00:41.43]But I look a little closer
[00:43.10]And it starts to feel familiar too
[00:51.70]What a strange new world~
[00:56.70]I'm trying to make heads or tails~
[00:59.31]Of this strange~ new world~
[01:04.58]Sorting through the small details
[01:06.93]Of this strange~ new world
[01:10.72]What a strange new~ world
