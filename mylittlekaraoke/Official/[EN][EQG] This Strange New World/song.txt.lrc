I've never seen a place
That's quite like this
Everything is turned around
This crazy world is upside down
Getting on my feet
It's the hand that I was dealt
But I don't have much time with them
Got to learn all that I can
They don't use any magic
Or fly with any wings
I don't get these funny clothes
Skinny legs or tiny nose
Everything's confusing
When it seems so~ new
But I look a little closer
And it starts to feel familiar too
What a strange new world~
I'm trying to make heads or tails~
Of this strange~ new world~
Sorting through the small details
Of this strange~ new world
What a strange new~ world
