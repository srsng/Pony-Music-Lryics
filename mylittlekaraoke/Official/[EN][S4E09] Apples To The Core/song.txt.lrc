Come on, Apples!
Y'all know this one!
Hot diggity!
Yee-haw!
Eeyup!
We travel the-e road
Of~ generations
Joined by a common bo-ond
We sing o-ur song
'Cross the pony nation
From Equestria and beyond
We're Apples forever
Apples together
We're fam'ly but so much mo-ore
No matter what comes
We will face the weather
We're Apples to the-e core
There's no-o place
That I'd rather be,
Than travellin' with my family
Friends all around come to join and see
As we sing out across the land
We're Apples forever
Apples together
We're fam'ly but so much mo-ore
No matter what comes
We will face the weather
We're Apples to the-e core
We're peas in a pod,
We'-re thick as thieves
Any clich√© you can throw at me
We're here for each other
Through thick a-and thin
You're a-always welcome with your Apple kin
You're more fun
Than the color pink
Or balloons flying over
Your fav'rite drink
The love I-I feel
Here is swim not sink
As we party across thi-is land
We're Apples forever
Apples together
We're fam'ly but so much mo-ore
No matter what comes
We will face the weather
We're Apples to the-e core
