[00:07.05]We're far apart in every wa-ay
[00:10.60]But you're the best part of my day
[00:14.20]And sure as I-I breathe the air
[00:17.95]I kno-ow we are the perfect pair
[00:21.10]On a prickly-y path that goes on for miles
[00:28.30]But it's worth i-it just to se-e you smi-i-i-i-i-ile
[00:35.70]And I cannot be pulled apa-art
[00:39.50]From the hold you have on my heart
[00:42.85]And even if the world tells us it's wro-ong
[00:47.80]You're in my he-ad like a catchy-y song
[00:50.80]Wow! It's just... wow!
[00:52.80]Do you like it? Be honest now!
[00:55.00]It's the best gift you could've given me!
[00:57.40]Seasons cha-ange and leaves may fa-all
[01:00.80]But I'll be with you through them all
[01:04.35]And rain or shi-ine, you'll alwa-ays be mi-i-i-i-ine
[01:11.25]On a prickly-y path that goes on for mi-iles
[01:18.40]You're the only-y one who makes it all worthwhi-i-i-i-i-ile
[01:26.30]And you should no-ot blame me, to-o
[01:29.95]If I can't help fallin' in love with you...
