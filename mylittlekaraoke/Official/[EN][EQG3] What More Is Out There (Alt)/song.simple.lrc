[00:19.55]I've walked through all these halls before
[00:26.41]I've been in and out of every door, oh-woah-oh
[00:33.05]There's nothing in this scho-ol that I-I don't kno-o-o-ow
[00:39.09]In every class my grade's the best
[00:42.50]The highest score on every test
[00:46.44]I think that means it's
[00:48.20]Time for me to go
[00:52.78]I know there's more that's out there
[00:56.15]And I just haven't found it ye-et
[00:59.60]I know there's more that's out there
[01:03.09]Another "me" I haven't met
[01:09.69]Everyone he-ere likes who I am
[01:16.10]And it's not from a magic spell's command, oh-woah-oh
[01:22.89]My friends look pa-ast the thi-ing I've do-one befo-ore
[01:29.34]Still I miss those quests
[01:32.19]The mythic creatures, magic tests
[01:36.16]Highschool's great, sure
[01:37.74]But who am I anymore?
[01:43.74]It's not that I'm ungra-ateful
[01:46.29]Or trying to succe-e-e-e-ed
[01:50.34]But there's something le-eft sti-ill mi-issing
[01:53.34]Something that I ne-ed
[01:56.19]I know there's more tha-at's out there
[01:59.79]Maybe folks that need my he-elp
[02:03.05]I know there's more that's out there
[02:06.42]Because I've seen it for myse-elf
[02:09.88]There's only so much this town can offer
[02:13.36]And I'm not saying that's so ba-ad
[02:16.96]But I know there's more that's out the-ere
[02:20.19]'Cause it's a life tha-at I once had
[02:26.38]Beyond these rooms, beyond these wa-alls
[02:33.20]So much to learn, I can't se-e-e it a-a-all
[02:40.10]This town is home, this school is sa-a-a-a-a-afe
[02:47.00]But how can I be home
[02:49.70]And still feel out of pla-a-ace?
[02:52.93]And I know there's more that's out there
[02:56.15]Another world to explore
[02:59.83]And I know there's more that's out there
[03:03.20]Am I wrong for wanti-ing mo-ore?
[03:08.23]And I can't wait for it to-o happen
[03:11.60]Though what it is I cannot sa-ay
[03:15.20]I just know there's more that's out the-ere
[03:18.65]And it's calling out my na-ame
[03:22.03]And I'm searching for the answer
[03:25.48]'Cause I feel I lost my wa-ay
[03:28.70]I mean I know it's re-ally out there
[03:32.60]But I'll find out someday
[03:39.61]I'll find out someday
