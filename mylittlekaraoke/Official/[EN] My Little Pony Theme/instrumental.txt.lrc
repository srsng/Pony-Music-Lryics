My Little Pony, My Little Pony
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I used to wonder what friendship could be
Until you all shared its magic with me
Big adventures, tons of fun
A beautiful heart, faithful and strong
Sharing kindness, it's an easy feat
and magic makes it all complete
You are my~
Do you know you're all my very best friends
