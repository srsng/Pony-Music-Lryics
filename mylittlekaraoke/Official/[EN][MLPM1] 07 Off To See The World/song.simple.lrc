[00:18.57]So we wanna stay
[00:21.47]But can't find peace while sittin' still~
[00:24.26]I guess we never will
[00:28.26]We're on the way
[00:30.62]We won't hurry back again~
[00:33.26]The journey is the end
[00:37.04]I love this very moment
[00:39.20]We're speedin' up, not slowin'
[00:41.83]We might know we can't win~
[00:44.10]But we're dumb enough to try
[00:46.20]We're going, there's no maybe
[00:48.20]That's why they call us crazy
[00:51.47]And we'll say if anybody asks us
[00:54.73]Hey, where you gonna go?
[00:57.94]We're off to see the world
[01:00.36]We don't need to know
[01:03.68]Hey, where you gonna go?
[01:06.89]We're off to see the world
[01:09.31]We don't need to know
[01:12.78]We never need to know
[01:15.47]Seekin' boundaries to break~
[01:17.68]Let's forget the ones we've made
[01:21.94]So we carry on~~
[01:24.47]Don't let good things pass us by
[01:26.57]The time we're gone will be the
[01:28.31]Best time of our life
[01:30.83]I love this very moment
[01:32.99]We're speedin' up, not slowin'
[01:35.62]We might know we can't win~
[01:37.89]But we're dumb enough to try
[01:39.99]We're going, there's no maybe
[01:41.99]That's why they call us crazy
[01:45.26]And we'll say if anybody asks us
[01:48.52]Hey, where you gonna go?
[01:51.73]We're off to see the world
[01:54.15]We don't need to know
[01:57.47]Hey, where you gonna go?
[02:00.68]We're off to see the world
[02:03.10]We don't need to know
[02:05.47]So go tell 'em we won't stop
[02:07.89]We know they can't change us
[02:10.04]We're gonna go way off the map
[02:12.36]To get ourselves back on the track
[02:14.57]Go tell 'em we won't stop
[02:16.83]We know they can't change us
[02:19.10]No need to worry so much
[02:21.31]We do whatever we want
[02:24.41]Hey, where you gonna go?
[02:27.62]We're off to see the world
[02:30.04]We don't need to know
[02:33.36]Hey, where you gonna go?
[02:36.57]We're off to see the world
[02:38.99]We don't need to know
