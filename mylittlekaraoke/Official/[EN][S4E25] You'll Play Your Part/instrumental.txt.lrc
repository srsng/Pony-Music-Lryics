It isn't that I'm ungrateful
For all the things that I've earned
For all the journeys I have taken
All the lessons that I have learned
But I wonder where I'm going now~
What my role is meant to be
I don't know how to travel
To a future that I can't see
I have my wings, I wear this crown
I'm a princess, this is true
But it's still unclear to me
Just what I~ am meant to do
I wanna have a purpose
Wanna do all that I~ can
I wanna make a contribution
I want to be a part of the plan
Your destiny's uncertain
And that's sometimes hard to take
But it will become much clearer
With every new choice you make
Patience is never easy
I understand wanting more
I know how hard it is to wait
To spread out your wings and soar
But you stand here for a reason
You're gifted and you are strong
That crown is upon your head because
You belong
Know that your time is coming soon
As the sun rises, so does the moon
As love finds a place in every heart
You are a princess, you'll play your part
We understand you wanting more
A chance to shine, a chance to soar~
Soon will come the day it turns~ around~
Know that your time is coming soon
As the sun rises, so does the moon
As love finds a place in every heart
You are a princess, you'll play your part
You are a princess, you'll play your part
