Love i-is in bloom
A beautiful bride
A handso-me groom
Two hearts
Beco-oming one
A bond that ca-annot be-e undo-ne because
Love is in blo-om
A beautiful bride, a handso-me groom
I said, love is in blo-om
You're starting a life
And maki-ing room
For us
Yo-ur special day
We celebrate now
The pony-y wa-y
Your friends
Are a-all right here
Won't let these mo-oments disappe-ar because
Love is in blo-om
A beautiful bride, a handso-me groom
I said, love is in blo-om
You're starting a life
And maki-ing room
