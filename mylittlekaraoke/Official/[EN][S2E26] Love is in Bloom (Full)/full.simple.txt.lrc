Love is in bloom
A beautiful bride
A handsome groom
Two hearts
Becoming one
A bond that cannot be undone because
Love is in blom
A beautiful bride, a handsome groom
I said, love is in blom
You're starting a life
And making room
For us
Your special day
We celebrate now
The pony way
Your friends
Are all right here
Won't let these moments disappear because
Love is in blom
A beautiful bride, a handsome groom
I said, love is in blom
You're starting a life
And making room
For us
For us
