[00:17.54]If you wanna be the life of the party
[00:19.87]But you're feeling just a little uptight
[00:22.49]Call the doctor, beg and plead
[00:23.81]"Doctor, tell me what I need"
[00:25.19]Try to put a little cheese in your knees!
[00:46.68]Just let yourself go floppy
[00:47.99]For now this is your chance
[00:49.38]Pretend you have no bones
[00:50.36] and do the rubber chicken dance!
[00:52.53]Hit it, Boneless!
[01:08.02]'Cause I like to make you smile, smile, smile
[01:09.86]Yes I do
[01:10.68]It fills my heart with sunshine all the while
[01:12.52]Yes it does
[01:13.38]'Cause all I really need's a smile, smile, smile
[01:15.18]From these happy friends of mine
[01:17.77]What do you mean?
[01:18.52]I have no idea what you're talking about
[01:26.66]Why should you compromise?
[01:27.97] Try this one on for size
[01:29.32]'Cause nothing quite says cheer
[01:30.48]Like the ringing in your ear
[01:31.87]Of the Cheese Supreme Cannonball Surprise!
