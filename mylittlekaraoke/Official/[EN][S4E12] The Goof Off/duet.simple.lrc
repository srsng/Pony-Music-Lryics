[00:01.53][P1] It's your birthday party, a very special day
[00:04.01][P1] I've got a song, it won't take long, I just wanted to say
[00:06.86][P1] Happy, happy, happy, happy
[00:08.21][P1] Happy, happy, happy, happy
[00:09.56][P1] Happy, happy, happy, happy birthday to you!
[00:17.54][P2] If you wanna be the life of the party
[00:19.87][P2] But you're feeling just a little uptight
[00:22.49][P2] Call the doctor, beg and plead
[00:23.81][P2] "Doctor, tell me what I need"
[00:25.19][P2] Try to put a little cheese in your knees!
[00:33.56][P1] Bubbles and balloons
[00:34.83][P1] Bubbles and balloons
[00:36.18][P1] What's a birthday party
[00:37.19][P1] Without bubbles and balloons?
[00:38.81][P1] Star-shaped or trapezoid
[00:40.16][P1] Look what I can do
[00:41.54][P1] Only Pinkie Pie can make
[00:42.71][P1] A bubble shaped like you!
[00:46.68][P2] Just let yourself go floppy
[00:47.99][P2] For now this is your chance
[00:49.38][P2] Pretend you have no bones
[00:50.36][P2]  and do the rubber chicken dance!
[00:52.53][P2] Hit it, Boneless!
[00:57.56][P1] Cooler than a rubber chicken
[00:59.02][P1] And tastier than cake
[01:00.22][P1] Come on, you, let's party down
[01:01.42][P1] And do the Gummy shake!
[01:03.52][P1] Hit it, Gummy! Uh huh! You know it! Shake it!
[01:08.02][P2] 'Cause I like to make you smile, smile, smile
[01:09.86][P2] Yes I do
[01:10.68][P2] It fills my heart with sunshine all the while
[01:12.52][P2] Yes it does
[01:13.38][P2] 'Cause all I really need's a smile, smile, smile
[01:15.18][P2] From these happy friends of mine
[01:16.72][P1] That's my song!
[01:17.77][P2] What do you mean?
[01:18.52][P2] I have no idea what you're talking about
[01:20.24][P1] That's it!
[01:21.56][P1] Roll out the party cannon
[01:24.18][P1] When you hear the party cannon song
[01:25.91][P1] Ka -BOOM!
[01:26.66][P2] Why should you compromise?
[01:27.97][P2]  Try this one on for size
[01:29.32][P2] 'Cause nothing quite says cheer
[01:30.48][P2] Like the ringing in your ear
[01:31.87][P2] Of the Cheese Supreme Cannonball Surprise!
[01:34.83][P1] Dale dale dale
[01:36.18][P1] No pierdas el tino
[01:37.49][P1] Porque si lo pierdes
[01:38.88][P1] Pierdes el camino!
