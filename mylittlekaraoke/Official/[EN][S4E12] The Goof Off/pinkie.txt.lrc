It's your birthday party, a very special day
I've got a song, it won't take long, I just wanted to say
Happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy birthday to you!
Bubbles and balloons
Bubbles and balloons
What's a birthday party
Without bubbles and balloons?
Star-shaped or trapezoid
Look what I can do
Only Pinkie Pie can make
A bubble shaped like you!
Cooler than a rubber chicken
And tastier than cake
Come on, you, let's party down
And do the Gummy shake!
Hit it, Gummy! Uh huh! You know it! Shake it!
That's my song!
That's it!
Roll out the party cannon
When you hear the party cannon song
Ka -BOOM!
Dale dale dale
No pierdas el tino
Porque si lo pierdes
Pierdes el camino!
