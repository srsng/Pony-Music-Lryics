Morning in Ponyville shimmers
Morning in Ponyville shines
And I know for absolute certain
That everything is certainly fine
There's the mayor en route to her office
There's the sofa clerk selling some quills
Morning, kid!
My Ponyville is so gentle and still
Can things ever go wrong?
I don't think that they will.
Morning in Ponyville shimmers
Morning in Ponyville shines
And I know for absolute certain
That everything is certainly...
Life in Equestria shimmers
Life in Equestria shines
And I know for absolute certain
That everything
Yes everything
Yes everything is certainly fine
It's fine
Yes, everything is gonna be just fine
