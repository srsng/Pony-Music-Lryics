We may be divided
But of you all I beg
To remember we're all hoofed
At the end of each leg
No matter what the issue
Come from wherever you please
All this fighting gets you nothing
But hoof and mouth disease
Arguing's not the way
Hey come out and play
It's a shiny new day so what do yah say
You gotta share, you gotta care
It's the right thing to do
You gotta share, you gotta care
And there'll always be a way through
Both our diets I should mention
Are completely vegetarian
We all eat hay and oats
Why be at each others throats
You gotta share, you gotta care
It's the right thing to do
And there'll always be a way through
