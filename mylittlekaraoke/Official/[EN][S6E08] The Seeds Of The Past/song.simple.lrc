[00:06.35]As a young thi-ing, life sure is somethin'
[00:10.24]You go makin' choices large a-and small
[00:14.17]Always growin' like a seedlin'
[00:16.49]And playin' is like dre-amin'
[00:18.55]And before you know it, big and ta-all
[00:24.72]And every little bitty choice you ma-ake
[00:28.54]Sends you down a path to who you are toda-ay
[00:32.96]So let's take a little trip down memo-o-ry-y lane
[00:37.15]And see just what the past has to say
[00:43.06]Aww, look how cute you were!
[00:45.08]Looks like you're not too upset
[00:46.28]It's Hearth's Warmin'~ Eve either
[00:48.60]The seeds of the past
[00:50.88]They grow pretty fast
[00:53.08]Just look at who you were back the-en
[00:57.50]The seeds, as they grow
[00:59.67]Look what they can show
[01:01.88]Reveal the truth time and aga-in
[01:08.35]Then some distress
[01:10.56]Words so ca-areless
[01:12.92]Standin' there, you don't know what to do
[01:17.37]Feelin' helpless
[01:19.50]You can't make it hurt less
[01:21.82]So you go and change your point of view
[01:26.68]And in that moment, though you didn't know it
[01:31.06]Your defenses set up walls you've built to last
[01:35.48]Leading to the pony you've become today
[01:39.37]And the spell you're about to cast
[01:41.76]It all comes from yo-ur pa-ast
[01:45.09]The seeds of the past
[01:47.49]We grow up so fast
[01:49.70]Some hurts never go away
[01:54.18]The seeds, as the-ey grow
[01:56.39]This we can't let go
[01:58.60]All tied to this one holida-ay
