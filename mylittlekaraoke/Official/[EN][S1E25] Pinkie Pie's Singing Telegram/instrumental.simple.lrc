[00:01.92]I hope it finds you well
[00:03.33]You're invited to a party
[00:04.58]'cause we think you're really swell
[00:06.50]Gummy's turning one year old
[00:07.75]So help us celebrate
[00:09.25]The cake will be delicious
[00:10.58]The festivities first-rate
[00:13.00]There will be games and dancing
[00:14.25]Bob for apples, cut-a-rug
[00:15.92]And when the party's over
[00:17.08]We'll gather 'round for a group hug
[00:19.67]No need to bring a gift
[00:21.33]Being there will be enough
[00:23.58]Birthdays mean having fun with friends
[00:25.25]Not getting lots of stuff
[00:27.92]It won't be the same without you
[00:30.08]So we hope that you say "yes"
[00:32.67]So please, oh please, RSVP
[00:35.00]And come and be our guest
