This is your singing telegram
I hope it finds you well
You're invited to a party
'cause we think you're really swell
Gummy's turning one year old
So help us celebrate
The cake will be delicious
The festivities firstrate
There will be games and dancing
Bob for apples, cutarug
And when the party's over
We'll gather 'round for a group hug
No need to bring a gift
Being there will be enough
Birthdays mean having fun with friends
Not getting lots of stuff
It won't be the same without you
So we hope that you say "yes"
So please, oh please, RSVP
And come and be our guest
