[00:00.53]Woke up this morning feeling tired and small
[00:03.92]But look at us now
[00:05.37]We must be ninety feet tall
[00:08.31]Don't have to worry 'bout
[00:10.00]Making mistakes, because
[00:12.18]Being big is all it takes
[00:16.01]A tiny twist of fate brought on this big change
[00:19.20]Give me room, gotta zoom
[00:21.13]I've got plans to arrange
[00:23.31]Can do what I want
[00:25.00]Be it run, trot, or traipse
[00:27.14]'Cause being big is
[00:29.60]All it takes
[00:30.81]Being big isn't just a size~
[00:34.92]At bedtime we don't even have
[00:36.86]To close our eyes
[00:38.39]We're in control now for goodness' sake~
[00:42.71]'Cause being big is
[00:45.08]All it takes
[00:46.98]Leaving behind the little pony you've known
[00:50.17]Stepping out, growing up
[00:52.06]Making moves of my own
[00:54.28]You can't tell me no
[00:55.97]There's no place I can't go
[00:58.35]Mountains, cities, jungles, or lakes
[01:02.02]'Cause being big is
[01:04.16]All it takes
[01:05.69]Being big isn't just a size~
[01:09.76]We'll tell you our opinion 'cause we're
[01:11.90]Oh so wise
[01:13.19]We're in control now for goodness' sake~
[01:17.50]'Cause being big is
[01:19.88]All it takes
[01:21.09]I can eat all the snacks
[01:22.83]'Cause that's for me to decide
[01:25.00]We know how it all works
[01:26.94]Even what we ain't tried~
[01:29.36]Facts don't matter now
[01:30.85]'Cause it's not what we know
[01:32.75]We can win~ any argument with
[01:35.37]"Because I say~ so~!"
[01:37.30]Can't stop us now, don't try to stand in our way
[01:40.49]We're awake, gonna take
[01:42.42]All we can from today
[01:44.80]Once we had to listen, now you'll hear what we say
[01:48.71]Everything is always okay
[01:52.34]'Cause being big is
[01:54.52]All it takes~
[01:58.35]All it takes
