I've walked through all these halls before
I've been in and out of every door, woahoh
There's nothing in this schol that I don't know
In ev'ry class my grade's the best
The highest score on ev'ry test
I think that means it's time for me to go
I know there's more that's out there
And I just haven't found it yet
I know there's more that's out there
Another "me" I haven't met
This school is full of people
But still I don't belong
They only dream of winning
Look at me like something's wrong
Maybe I'm better off alone
Will I find what I'm loking for
If I just do it on my own?
I know there's more that's out there
Something to fill this hole inside
I know there's more that's out there
And I'm not afraid to try
There's only so much this school can offer
And I'm not saying that it's wrong
But I know there's more that's out there
'Cause I've been searching all along
Beyond these rooms, beyond these walls
So much to learn, I can't se it all
There's something out there calling me
And it's a mystery that I can't wait to se
'Cause I know there's more that's out there
Another place, another way
And I know there's more that's out there
And I'll find out someday
I'll find out someday
