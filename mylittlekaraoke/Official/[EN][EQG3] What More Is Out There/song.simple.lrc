[00:07.44]I've walked through a-all these halls before
[00:14.35]I've been in and o-ut of every door, woah-ah-oh
[00:21.01]There's nothing in this scho-ol that I-I don't kno-o-o-o-ow
[00:27.00]In ev'ry class my grade's the best
[00:30.49]The highest score on ev'ry test
[00:34.31]I think that means it's time for me to go
[00:40.73]I know there's more that's out there
[00:44.10]And I just haven't found it ye-et
[00:47.56]I know there's more that's out there
[00:50.97]Another "me" I haven't met
[00:57.32]This school is full of people
[00:59.93]But still I don't belong
[01:04.18]They only dream of winning
[01:06.59]Look at me like something's wro-ong
[01:11.29]Maybe I'm better off alone
[01:17.72]Will I find what I'm lo-oking for
[01:20.12]If I just do it on my-y-y o-own?
[01:23.58]I know there's more that's out there
[01:26.95]Something to fill this hole insi-ide
[01:30.41]I know there's mo-ore that's out there
[01:34.02]And I'm not afraid to try-y
[01:37.23]There's only so much this school can offer
[01:40.73]And I'm not saying that it's wro-ong
[01:44.26]But I know there's more that's out the-ere
[01:47.51]'Cause I've been searching all along
[01:53.70]Beyond these rooms, beyond these wa-alls
[02:00.52]So much to learn, I can't se-e it a-a-all
[02:07.39]There's something out there calli-ing me-e-e-e-e-e
[02:14.30]And it's a mystery that I can't wait to se-e-e
[02:20.32]'Cause I know there's more that's out there
[02:23.45]Another place, another way
[02:27.19]And I know there's more that's out there
[02:30.76]And I'll find out someda-ay
[02:37.83]I'll find out someday
