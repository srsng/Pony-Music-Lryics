Or, maybe I'm still having it.
Rarity, Pinkie Pie is about
To lose the apple farm
We need Applejack's help!
Lose the apple farm?
Well we can't let that happen,
Now can we?

We need to get there

For together we can be her guide

Yee-haw! Now that's more like it!
What's next?
The townspeople are furious
We need the old Pinkie Pie back
I'm on it, I know just the thing
The townspeople need you,
They've been sad for a while
They march around, faces frown
And never seem to smile
And if you feel like helping,
We'd appreciate a lot!
If you get up there and spread some cheer
From here to Canterlot!
Come on ponies,
I wanna see you smile!
Pinkie!
A true, true friend
Helps a friend in need
A friend will be there
To help them see
A true, true frie-nd
Helps a friend in need
To see the light
That shines
From a true, true friend!
