Glowin' up
Kind of love
Dip and slide
Through the cut
Glowin' up
Kind of love
We say "Hi"
You say "What?"
Oohoohooh, ooh ooh, ooh
Oohoohooh, ooh ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to care what they'd say
Let 'em into my brain
But I found a new way
Oohooh
Every time I fall down
I pick it up like rebound~
Gotta get through somehow
We don't fly like we used to
We take what we've been through
And we can feel brand new
Oohooh
I know I am a fight~er
I feel the fire~
I'm shining brighter
Oohoohoo
We got the light
We're coming in stronger~
We're in it together
If you want it it's all inside your mind
We got the light
Won't wait any longer~
We'll get it together
If you want it then you can paint the sky~

You say "What?"
Everywhere that I've been
Yeah, they say I'm different~
But I'm good in my skin
Oohooh hey!
If it doesn't feel right
Break it in with tiedye~~
And don't you stop 'til sunrise~
We don't fly like we used to
We take what we've been through
And we can feel brand new
Oohoohoo
I know I am a fight~er
I feel the fire~~
I'm shining bright~er
Oohoohoo
