Glowin' up
Kind of love
Dip and slide
Through the cut
Glowin' up
Kind of love
We say "Hi"
You say "What?"
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to care what they'd say
Let 'em into my brain
But I found a new way
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Every time I fall down
I pick it up like rebound~
Gotta get through somehow
We don't fly like we used to
We take what we've been through
And we can feel brand new
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I know I am a fight~er
I feel the fire~
I'm shining brighter
Ooh-hoo-hoo
We got the light
We're coming in stronger~
We're in it together
If you want it it's all inside your mind
We got the light
Won't wait any longer~
We'll get it together
If you want it then you can paint the sky~

We say "Hi"
You say "What?"
Everywhere that I've been
Yeah, they say I'm different~
But I'm good in my skin
Ooh-hoo-ooh hey!
If it doesn't feel right
Break it in with tie-dye~~
And don't you stop 'til sunrise~
We don't fly like we used to
We take what we've been through
And we can feel brand new
Ooh-hoo-hoo
I know I am a fight~er
I feel the fire~~
I'm shining bright~er
Ooh-hoo-hoo
We got the light
We're coming in stronger~
We're in it together
If you want it it's all inside your mind
