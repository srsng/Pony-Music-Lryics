Well, lookie what we got here,
Brother of mine,
It's the same in every town
Ponies with thirsty throats, dry tongues,
And not a drop of cider to be found
Maybe they're not aware
That there's really no need
For this teary despair
That the key that they need
To solve the sad cider shortage
You and I will sha-are
Well you've got opportunity
In this very community

Non-pa... what?
Nonpareil, that's exactly
The reason why, you see
No pony else in this whole place
Will give you such a chance
To be where you need to be
*smeck*
And that's a new world,
With tons of cider
Fresh squeezed and ready for drinking
More cider than you could drink
In all your days of thinking
I doubt that.
So take this opportunity

I suppose by now you're wondering
'Bout our peculiar mode of transport
I say, our mode of locomo-otion
And I suppose by now you're wondering,
Where is this promised cider?
Any horse can make a claim
And any pony can do the same
But my brother and I have something
Most unique and superb
Unseen at any time
In this big new world
And that's opportu-unity
Folks, the one and only,
The biggest and the best
The unbelievable
Unimpeachable
Indispensable
I can't believe-able

Young filly, I would be ever so honored
If you might see fit
To let my brother and I
Borrow some of your delicious,
And might I add
Spell-bindingly fragrant apples
For our little demonstration here?
Uh, sure, I guess.

And show these thirsty ponies
A world of delectable cider!
Cider, cider, cider, cider...
Watch closely my friends!
The fun begins!
Now, here's where the magic happens,
Right here in this heaving
Roiling cider press boiling guts
Of the very machine.
Those apples plucked fresh
Are right now as we speak
Being turned into grade-A
Top-notch

Blow-your-horseshoes-off
One of a kind cider!
Feel free to take a sneak peek!
Now wait, you fellers, hold it!
You went and oversold it!
I guarantee that
What you have there
Won't compare
For the very most important ingredient
Can't be added or done expedient
And that's quality, friends,
Apple Acre's quality and care!
Well Granny,
I'm glad you brought that up, my dear,
I say I'm glad you brought that up
You see, that we are very picky
When it comes to cider
If you'll kindly try a cup
Yes, sir, yes ma'am this great machine,
Lets just the very best
So what'ya say then, Apples
Care to step into the modern world
And put the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy
Six Thousand to the test?
