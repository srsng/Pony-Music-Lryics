[00:00.24][P1] There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world
[00:05.08][P2] There's a lotta little things you gotta try
[00:09.84][P1] Just a pack of punchy plunges other ponies all take
[00:14.68][P2] That have princess-pony-passed us right by
[00:19.14][P1] Nopony knows you like your little sister
[00:19.14][P2] Nopony knows you like your little sister
[00:23.98][P1] Nopony is a better confidante
[00:23.98][P2] Nopony is a better confidante
[00:28.74][P1] Nopony is truer than the one you are
[00:28.74][P2] Nopony is truer than the one you are
[00:34.18][P1] Nopony else here I could want
[00:34.18][P2] Nopony else here I could want
[00:41.04][P1] You can't saunter on a sojourn hid behind castle walls
[00:45.84][P2] You can't throw a throne down on the beach
[00:50.64][P1] So we're gonna be absconding
[00:53.08][P2] To a little vagabonding
[00:55.44][P1] And this bucket list is gonna be a peach
[00:59.94][P1] Nopony knows you like your older sister
[00:59.94][P2] Nopony knows you like your older sister
[01:04.78][P1] Nopony is a better confidante
[01:04.78][P2] Nopony is a better confidante
[01:09.58][P1] Nopony is truer than the one you are
[01:09.58][P2] Nopony is truer than the one you are
[01:14.98][P1] Nopony else here I could want
[01:14.98][P2] Nopony else here I could want
[01:19.44][P1] There's a lotta little things you gotta try in this world
[01:19.44][P2] There's a lotta little things you gotta try in this world
[01:24.24][P1] There's a lotta little things you gotta see
[01:24.24][P2] There's a lotta little things you gotta see
[01:29.11][P2] But just reading by a river
[01:31.74][P2] And resting our hooves
[01:34.14][P2] Would practically be perfect for me
[01:38.38][P1] Nopony knows you like your sister
[01:38.38][P2] Nopony knows you like your sister
[01:43.10][P1] Nopony is a better confidante
[01:43.10][P2] Nopony is a better confidante
[01:47.94][P1] Nopony is truer than the one you are
[01:47.94][P2] Nopony is truer than the one you are
[01:53.34][P1] Nopony else here I could want
[01:53.34][P2] Nopony else here I could want
[02:00.20][P1] You can't venture on adventures if you're taking a nap
[02:05.00][P1] You can't check things off your checklist while you sleep
[02:09.80][P1] So let's take another hill
[02:12.31][P2] Sometimes you can be a pill
[02:14.94][P2] And why's the way ahead always so steep?
[02:20.87][P1] There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world
[02:26.08][P2] There's a lotta little things you ought to view~
[02:31.29][P1] And our little lotta list may be a little bit long
[02:36.47][P2] And might take a lotta bother to do
[02:41.34][P1] But I'm sure it gets better later on
[02:41.34][P2] But I'm sure it gets better later on
[02:46.70][P1] And after darkest night, a new dawn~
[02:52.14][P2] It's my turn to do the choosing
[02:54.77][P1] After river rapid cruising
[02:57.31][P1] This adventure isn't too fun to be on
[02:57.31][P2] This adventure isn't too fun to be on
