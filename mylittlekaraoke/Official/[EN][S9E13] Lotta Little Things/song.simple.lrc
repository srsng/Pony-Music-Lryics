[00:00.24]There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world
[00:05.08]There's a lotta little things you gotta try
[00:09.84]Just a pack of punchy plunges other ponies all take
[00:14.68]That have princess-pony-passed us right by
[00:19.14]Nopony knows you like your little sister
[00:23.98]Nopony is a better confidante
[00:28.74]Nopony is truer than the one you are
[00:34.18]Nopony else here I could want
[00:41.04]You can't saunter on a sojourn hid behind castle walls
[00:45.84]You can't throw a throne down on the beach
[00:50.64]So we're gonna be absconding
[00:53.08]To a little vagabonding
[00:55.44]And this bucket list is gonna be a peach
[00:59.94]Nopony knows you like your older sister
[01:04.78]Nopony is a better confidante
[01:09.58]Nopony is truer than the one you are
[01:14.98]Nopony else here I could want
[01:19.44]There's a lotta little things you gotta try in this world
[01:24.24]There's a lotta little things you gotta see
[01:29.11]But just reading by a river
[01:31.74]And resting our hooves
[01:34.14]Would practically be perfect for me
[01:38.38]Nopony knows you like your sister
[01:43.10]Nopony is a better confidante
[01:47.94]Nopony is truer than the one you are
[01:53.34]Nopony else here I could want
[02:00.20]You can't venture on adventures if you're taking a nap
[02:05.00]You can't check things off your checklist while you sleep
[02:09.80]So let's take another hill
[02:12.31]Sometimes you can be a pill
[02:14.94]And why's the way ahead always so steep?
[02:20.87]There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world
[02:26.08]There's a lotta little things you ought to view~
[02:31.29]And our little lotta list may be a little bit long
[02:36.47]And might take a lotta bother to do
[02:41.34]But I'm sure it gets better later on
[02:46.70]And after darkest night, a new dawn~
[02:52.14]It's my turn to do the choosing
[02:54.77]After river rapid cruising
[02:57.31]This adventure isn't too fun to be on
