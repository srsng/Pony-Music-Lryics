Do you think the coast is clear
No one to see, no one to hear
Me sing out my song
I think we're all alone
I don't need my name in lights
That's not where I've set my sights
No, ohuh, no, not me
I don't ned a stage to sing
To turn it up, to sing along
I'm not just shy
Look close, and you will see
There's so much more to me
I'm just fine rehearsing on my own
My hairbrush is my microphone
Look out now, I'm in the zone
Yeah! Can you feel it?
I like the quiet, I like the calm
To turn it up, to sing along
I'm not just shy
Look close, and you will see
There's so much more to 
I speak soft out in a crowd
I whisper, "am I being too loud?"
But when I close that dor
The crowd, it just wants
More and more and more
I like the quiet, I like the calm
To turn it up, to sing along
I'm not just shy
Look close, and you will see
There's so much more to 
I like my friends, I like my pets
I like to rock, do pirouettes
I'm more than shy
I'm more than you can see
There's so much more to me
