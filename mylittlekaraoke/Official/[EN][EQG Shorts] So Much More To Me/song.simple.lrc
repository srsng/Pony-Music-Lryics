[00:26.10]Do you think the coast is cle-ar
[00:29.55]No one to see, no one to hear
[00:33.37]Me sing out my song
[00:37.35]I think we're all alone
[00:40.65]I don't need my name in lights
[00:44.32]That's not where I've set my si-ights
[00:47.21]No, oh-uh, no, not me-e
[00:51.75]I don't ne-ed a sta-age to sing
[00:57.71]To turn it up, to sing alo-ong
[01:01.42]I'm not just shy
[01:03.22]Look close, and you wi-ill see
[01:06.94]There's so much more to-o me
[01:09.26]I'm just fine rehearsing on my-y own
[01:12.94]My hairbrush is my micro-opho-one
[01:16.76]Look out now, I-'m in the zone
[01:20.92]Yeah! Can you feel it?
[01:23.55]I like the quiet, I like the calm
[01:27.22]To turn it up, to sing alo-ong
[01:30.97]I'm not just shy
[01:32.74]Look close, and you wi-ill see
[01:36.45]There's so much more to --
[01:38.29]I speak soft out in a cro-owd
[01:42.04]I whisper, "am I being too lo-ud?"
[01:45.67]But when I clo-ose tha-at do-o-o-or
[01:49.35]The crowd, it just wants
[01:51.34]More and mo-ore and mo-ore
[01:55.01]I like the quiet, I like the calm
[01:58.61]To turn it up, to sing alo-ong
[02:02.29]I'm not just shy-y
[02:04.12]Look close, and you wi-ill see
[02:07.84]There's so much more to --
[02:09.67]I like my friends, I like my pets
[02:13.31]I like to rock, do pirouettes
[02:17.10]I'm more than shy-y
[02:18.94]I'm more than you can see
[02:22.61]There's so much more to-o me
