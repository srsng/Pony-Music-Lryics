[00:07.75]Look, here, are three little ponies 
[00:11.33]Ready to sing for this crowd 
[00:15.00]Listen up, 'cause here's our story 
[00:18.42]I'm gonna sing it
[00:20.08]Very loud
[00:29.58]When you're a younger pony 
[00:33.25]And your flank is very bare 
[00:36.83]Feels like the sun will never come
[00:40.50]When your cutie mark's not there
[00:44.00]So the three of us will fight the fight
[00:47.83]There is nothing that we fear
[00:51.17]We'll have to figure out what we'll do next 
[00:55.00]Till our cutie marks are here
[00:59.08]We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
[01:03.17]On a quest to find out who we are
[01:06.33]And we will never stop the journey 
[01:10.42]Not until we have our cutie marks
[01:20.58]They all say that you'll get your mark
[01:24.17]When the time is really right
[01:27.67]And you know just what you're supposed to do
[01:31.42]And your talent comes to light
[01:35.00]But it's not as easy as it sounds
[01:38.67]And that waiting's hard to do
[01:42.25]So we test our talents ev'rywhere 
[01:46.00]Until our face is blue
[01:50.00]We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
[01:54.08]On a quest to find out who we are
[01:57.08]And we will never stop the journey
[02:01.33]Not until we have our cutie marks
[02:04.42]We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
[02:08.58]On a quest to find out who we are
[02:11.83]And we will never stop the journey
[02:15.92]Not until we have our cutie marks
