[00:07.75]Look, here, are three little ponies 
[00:11.33]Ready to sing for this crowd 
[00:15.00]Listen up, 'cause here's our story 
[00:18.33]I'm gonna sing it
[00:20.08]Very loud
[00:29.58]When you're a younger pony 
[00:33.25]And your flank is very bare 
[00:36.83]Feels like the sun will never come
[00:40.50]When your cutie mark's not there
[00:44.00]So the three of us will fight the fight
[00:47.75]There is nothing that we-e fear
[00:51.17]We'll have to figure out what we'll do next 
[00:55.00]Till our cutie marks are here
[00:59.08]We are the Cutie Mark Crusa-aders
[01:03.17]On a quest to find out who we a-are
[01:06.33]And we will never sto-op the journey 
[01:10.46]Not until we have our cutie ma-arks
[01:20.54]They all say that you'll get your mark
[01:24.08]When the time is really right
[01:27.67]And you know just what you're suppo-osed to do
[01:31.42]And your talent comes to-o li-ight
[01:35.00]But it's not as easy as it sounds
[01:38.67]And that waiting's hard to do
[01:42.17]So we test our talents e-ev'rywhere 
[01:46.00]Until our fa-ace is blue
[01:50.00]We are the Cu-utie Mark Crusa-aders
[01:54.08]On a quest to find out who we are~
[01:57.17]And we will never stop the jo-urney
[02:01.33]Not until we have our cutie mark
[02:04.50]We are the Cutie Mark Crusa-aders
[02:08.58]On a quest to find out who we a-a-are
[02:11.83]And we will never stop the jo-urney
[02:15.83]Not until we have our cutie marks
