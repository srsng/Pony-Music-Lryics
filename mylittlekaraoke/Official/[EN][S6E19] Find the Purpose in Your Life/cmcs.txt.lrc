Like a racer at the starting line
You're chompin' at the bit
You are here to find your purpose
And the place you really-y fit
And until you find your place in life
You're never gonna quit
We can help you find the purpose in your life
That's the spirit!
You oughta see what you do best!
Try it all, pick your fave and leave behind the rest
Can we help her find the purpose in her life?
She's so good at things, it's frightening
Cutie Mark Crusaders,
I think we've got a problem!
Now how we gonna do this?
