Nothing stays the same for long
But when it changes doesn't mean it's gone
Time will always get away
As it leaves behind another day
Things may come and things may go
Some go fast and some go slow
Few things last, that's all I know
But friendship carries on through the ages
Things may come and things may go
Some go fast and some go slow
Few things last, that's all I know
But friendship carries on through the ages
Been around for a long time
Rockin' out hard, 'cause I'm in my prime
Maybe it'll change further down the line
But my friendship carries on through the ages
Every single style has somethin'
Diff'rent it can say
Nothin' wrong with bein' unique
And special in your own way
Maybe you wanna be a pop star
Get your fifteen minutes of fame, wahah, ahow
That won't last forever
But friendship remains the same, ahoh
Things may come and things may go
Some go fast and some go slow
Few things last, that's all I know
But friendship carries on through the ages
Things may come and things may go
Some go fast and some go slow
Few things last, that's all I know
But friendship carries on through the ages
Ohoh, carries on
