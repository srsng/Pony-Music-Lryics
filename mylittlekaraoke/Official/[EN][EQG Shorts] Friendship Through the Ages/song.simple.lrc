[00:10.76]Nothing stays the same for long
[00:13.28]But when it changes doesn't mean it's go-one
[00:17.85]Time will always get away
[00:20.63]As it leaves behind another da-ay
[00:25.09]Things may come and things may go
[00:28.54]Some go fast and some go-o slow
[00:31.91]Few things last, that's all I know
[00:34.95]But friendship carries on through the a-ages
[00:38.81]Things may come and things may go
[00:42.23]Some go fast and some go slow
[00:45.60]Few things last, that's all I know
[00:48.64]But fri-endship carries on through the a-ages
[00:52.50]Been around for a long time
[00:55.05]Rockin' out hard, 'cause I'm in my prime
[00:58.50]Maybe it'll change further do-own the line
[01:02.14]But my friendship carries on through the ages
[01:06.64]Every single style has so-omethin'
[01:09.64]Diff'rent it ca-an sa-ay
[01:13.54]Nothin' wro-ong with bein' unique
[01:16.24]And special in your o-own way
[01:20.14]Maybe you wanna be a pop star
[01:22.91]Get your fifteen minutes of fame, wah-ah, ah-ow
[01:27.19]That won't last fore-ever
[01:29.59]But friendship remains the same, ah-oh-oh
[01:33.64]Things may come and things may go
[01:37.05]Some go fast and some go-o slow
[01:40.46]Few things last, that's all I-I know
[01:43.46]But friendship carries on through the a-ages
[01:47.40]Things may come and things may go
[01:50.81]Some go fast and some go-o slow
[01:54.19]Few things last, that's all I know
[01:57.23]But friendship carries on through the a-ages
[02:01.13]Oh-oh, carries on
