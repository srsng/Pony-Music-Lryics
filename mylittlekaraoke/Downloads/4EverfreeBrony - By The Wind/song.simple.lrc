[00:22.86]O~ver the blue the invisible current blows
[00:26.43]A wave that can't be~ seen
[00:29.29]And we are dri-iven away to somewhere nobody knows
[00:34.05]Away from everything
[00:36.43]And we~ are~ fear~ful for both our~ lives
[00:41.67]We ma-ay just not survi-ive
[00:44.53]Within this bre-eeze
[00:48.34]Within this bre-eeze
[00:53.34]O-oh-o-oh wo-o-oah
[00:56.67]'Cross the water by the wind we go
[01:00.96]O-oh-oh wo-o-oah
[01:04.29]Still our final stop remains unknown
[01:07.38]If we~ could sail through the o~cean
[01:10.48]Pa-addle with so-omething
[01:12.38]Fate mi-ight let us float
[01:15.00]And as we ro-o-o-o-o-ow
[01:21.67]The life in the air will let us know
[01:23.81]Out~ of the way of any civilization known
[01:27.30]It seems wе've gone too~ far
[01:30.24]And I could look~ from a cloud but I'll nevеr leave you alone
[01:35.00]For when the tide~ hits hard
[01:37.50]And we~ are~ fear~ful for both our~ lives
[01:42.62]We ma-ay just not survi-ive
[01:45.48]So ma~ny scars
[01:49.29]So many sca-ars
[01:54.29]O-oh-o-oh wo-o-oah
[01:57.62]'Cross the water by the wind we go
[02:01.87]O-oh-oh wo-o-oah
[02:05.24]Still our final stop remains unknown
[02:08.34]If we~ could sail through the o~cean
[02:11.43]Pa-addle with so-omething
[02:13.34]Fate mi-ight let us float
[02:15.96]And as we ro-o-o-o-o-ow
[02:23.81]As we ro-o-o-o-o-o-ow
[03:02.82]O-oh-o-oh wo-o-oah
[03:06.19]'Cross the water by the wind we go
[03:10.44]O-oh-oh wo-o-oah
