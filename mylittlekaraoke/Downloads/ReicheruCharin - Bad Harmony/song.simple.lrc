[00:56.56]In the labyrinth
[00:57.86]Ever-changing
[00:59.17]All around me, like puppets on strings
[01:01.34]We fall victim to his master plan and
[01:03.52]I can't even see
[01:04.82]That this path will
[01:06.13]Ul timately lead us to the end
[01:08.30]Of our own friendship, no
[01:10.47]I'm not thinking straight
[01:11.78]Words of riddles
[01:13.08]Echo around, we continue on
[01:15.26]Blindly aiming for what we believed in
[01:17.43]With a flap of wings
[01:18.73]It's all over
[01:20.04]The walls fall down, everything I knew
[01:22.21]Is now lost to chaos
[01:24.39]Is this just a dream?
[01:25.69]Nothing's what it used to be
[01:27.43]And my patience's wearing thin
[01:29.17]Can't they hear what I'm saying?
[01:30.91]So the truth turned into lies
[01:32.65]A last cry of laughter dies
[01:34.39]The burden of charity
[01:36.13]No kindness or loyalty
[01:37.86]Even with the elements
[01:39.60]This all merely feels pointless
[01:41.34]My head knows just what to do
[01:43.08]But my heart can't follow through
[01:44.82]All the anger and despair
[01:46.56]Burn up till there's nothing there
[01:48.30]I just wanted it to change
[01:50.04]Feeling myself turn to grey
[01:51.78]Was there ever any hope?
[01:53.52]Can't I trust in what I know?
[01:55.26]I think I may as well leave
[01:56.99]As there's no more place for me
[01:58.73]What can I still be feeling?
[02:00.47]Certain magic is missing
[02:02.21]But I don't care how it ends
[02:03.95]What's the point without my friends?
[02:05.69]I am tired of being here
[02:07.43]I want them to disappear
[02:09.17]His wicked voice eggs me on
[02:10.96]I can't tell what's right from wrong
[02:12.70]But if anyway somehow
[02:14.39]I could turn it all around
[02:16.13]I'd remind them what I've learned
[02:17.86]And make their colours return
[02:47.86]In the labyrinth
[02:49.17]Ever-changing
[02:50.47]All around me, like puppets on strings
[02:52.65]We fall victim to his master plan and
[02:54.82]I can't even see
[02:56.13]That this path will
[02:57.43]Ultimately lead us to the end
[02:59.60]Of our own friendship, no
[03:01.78]I'm not thinking straight
[03:03.08]Words of riddles
[03:04.39]Acho around, we continue on
[03:06.56]Blindly aiming for what we believed in
[03:08.73]With a flap of wings
[03:10.04]It's all over
[03:11.34]The walls fall down, everything I knew
[03:13.52]Is now lost to chaos
[03:15.69]Is this just a dream?
[03:16.99]Nothing's what it used to be
[03:18.73]And my patience's wearing thin
[03:20.47]Can't they hear what I'm saying?
[03:22.21]So the truth turned into lies
[03:23.95]A last cry of laughter dies
[03:25.69]The burden of charity
[03:27.43]No kindness or loyalty
[03:29.17]Even with the elements
[03:30.91]This all merely feels pointless
[03:32.65]My head knows just what to do
[03:34.39]But my heart can't follow through
[03:36.13]All the anger and despair
[03:37.86]Burn up till there's nothing there
[03:39.60]I just wanted it to change
[03:41.34]Feeling myself turn to grey
[03:43.08]Is this just a waste of time?
[03:44.82]Was our friendship so fragile?
[03:46.56]Can I find the words to say
[03:48.30]That it mattered anyway?
[03:50.04]I have let everyone down
[03:51.78]This time there is no way out
[03:53.52]If you asked to describe me
[03:55.26]I'd say I'm "bad harmony"
[03:57.02]I am tired of being here
[03:58.76]I want them to disappear
[04:00.45]His wicked voice eggs me on
[04:02.21]I can't tell what's right from wrong
[04:03.95]But if anyway somehow
[04:05.69]I could turn it all around
[04:07.43]I'd remind them what I've learned
[04:09.17]And make their colours return
[04:10.91]So now is this just a dream?
[04:12.65]Nothing's what it used to be
[04:14.39]And my patience's wearing thin
[04:16.13]Can't they hear what I'm saying?
[04:17.86]So the truth turned into lies
[04:19.60]A last cry of laughter dies
[04:21.34]The burden of charity
[04:23.08]No kindness or loyalty
[04:24.82]Even with the elements
[04:26.56]This all merely feels point less
[04:28.30]My head knows just what to do
[04:30.04]But my heart can't follow through
[04:31.78]All the anger and despair
[04:33.52]Burn up till there's nothing there
[04:35.26]I just wanted it to change
[04:36.99]Feeling myself turn to grey
[04:38.73]All the words that I once wrote
[04:40.47]All the words that I once wrote
[04:42.21]They are worth more than I know
[04:43.95]They are worth more than I know
[04:45.69]I remembered what it's like
[04:47.43]I remembered what it's like
[04:49.17]So with my friends by my side
[04:50.91]Cleanse the world in rainbow light
[04:52.73]There are still a lot of things
[04:54.44]That I don't know the meaning
[04:56.13]All about my friends and me
[04:57.86]But I just will keep learning
[04:59.60]So ~ if you find you feel
[05:01.29]That you're losing what is real
[05:03.03]All throughout the thin and thick
[05:04.77]Know that friendship is magic
