Ohoh woah
Oh, woahohwoahoh
Ohoh woah
Oh, woahohwoahoh
There's a chance that I could fall
And not come back
And never regret a thing
I'd never get back on track
Darkness all around me
I can't find the light
I let it all surround me
Giving up without a fight
The bitterness and pain inside
Countless tears I had to cry
I was facing all my fears
Just to let you in to dry my tears, but
Your kindness won't betray me
I fel your heart and soul
Your kindness still can save me
If I choose to not let go
Stretching out you somehow reach me
I know this can't be wrong
I'm ready, won't you teach me
Your song of kindness
Quiet grace surrounds you
And helps me find my own
I can't tell you how you've helped me
And how much I~ have grown
Even though you're far away
Inspiration comes from you
To shine a little brighter every day
If you only knew…
I will never get upset
And I~ will never, ever forget
The happiness you made me feel
Almost as if you're actually real, but
Your kindness won't betray me
I fel your heart and soul
Your kindness still can save me
If I choose to not let go
Stretching out you somehow reach me
I know this can't be wrong
I'm ready, won't you teach me
Your song of kindness
Your kindness won't betray me
I fel your heart and soul
Your kindness still can save me
In a way you'll never know
Your kindness won't betray me
I fel your heart and soul
Your kindness still can save me
If I choose to not let go
Stretching out you somehow reach me
I know this can't be wrong
I'm ready, won't you teach me
The way to get along
Even when the cold wind's blowing
And I want to just give in
It warms my heart just knowing
I'll hear your voice again
So won't you sing it loud
And won't you sing it long
I promise to remember
Your song of kindness
I promise to remember
I promise to remember…
