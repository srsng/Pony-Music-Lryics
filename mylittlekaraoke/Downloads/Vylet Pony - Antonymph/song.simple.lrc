[00:28.87]I messaged somepony over Tumblr last night
[00:32.05]She said "RAWR X3" so it's true love at first sight
[00:36.18]Throw on my kandi bracelets
[00:37.81]Now I'm headed to class
[00:39.29]I'm still twenty percent
[00:41.18]So get your head out your ass~~~
[00:44.10]I'm the antonymph
[00:45.46]Of the internet
[00:47.09]Still cleaning up the viruses
[00:49.36]That you had left~~~
[00:51.14]I think I'm falling in love again
[00:55.01]Don't stop, don't stop until you hear the yay
[00:58.64]I'm the antonymph
[01:00.04]Of the internet
[01:01.64]Been fighting on Newgrounds over if my love is valid
[01:05.92]Fuck the cynicism let the colours fly
[01:08.87]Don't care you think it's cringe because it's not your life~~~
[01:14.10]She said do you like waffles? I said HELL YEAH!
[01:18.00]Been watching Equals Three until 2am
[01:21.56]I ain't got no iPhone but I got a DS
[01:25.01]With a keychain of Pinkie
[01:26.64]Her cupcakez are the best
[01:28.64]I've been failing my classes
[01:30.46]'Cuz I don't give a damn

[02:30.69]It's never too late to fall in love with the world
[02:34.32]Your past is not today so set your stride with a twirl
[02:37.73]Yeah we've all made mistakes before
[02:40.23]That's a fact of life~
[02:42.05]But once you restitch your heart
[02:43.91]You'll be just fine~
[02:46.64]Now it's your life, you'll say "It's all mine!
[02:50.46]All mine..."~
