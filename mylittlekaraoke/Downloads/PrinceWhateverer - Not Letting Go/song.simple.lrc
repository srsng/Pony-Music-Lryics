[00:37.84]Hey Fluttershy listen to me
[00:39.25]When I say you do not need any of this
[00:42.98]There's no way that changing who you are
[00:44.94]Could prove to us that you're assertive
[00:48.11]They can't tell you how to act
[00:50.40]When they don't know what you've been through
[00:53.32]The only one who can decide to try and change this is you
[01:03.55]You gotta keep it together
[01:08.64]Little filly tell me now~
[01:11.25]Why this angel never leaves the ground
[01:13.77]She's not the type to follow through
[01:16.18]This story's pages start and end with you
[01:18.99]She's left out in the rain~
[01:21.51]She's too shy to complain~
[01:24.04]Just suck it up and let it go
[01:26.65]How she feels inside we'll neverâ€¦
[01:28.89]One two three four
[01:31.78]Her eyes glued to the floor
[01:34.02]Five six seven eight~
[01:36.91]Left feeling second rate
[01:39.48]While her dreams pass her by~~
[01:44.61]She'll wish she weren't so shy~~
[01:50.71]Why can't I just make myself be less scared to try~
[01:55.56]The things I wish I could do like soar into the sky~
[02:00.65]The more I try to hide my doubts the~ more that I find~
[02:05.78]Perhaps I should give up and just pretend I don't mind~
[02:10.27]Little filly tell me now~
[02:12.84]Why this angel never leaves the ground
[02:15.37]She's not the type to follow through
[02:17.81]This story's pages start and end with you
[02:20.54]She's left out in the rain~
[02:23.11]She's too shy to complain~
[02:25.67]Just suck it up and let it go
[02:28.24]How she feels inside we'll never know~~~~
[02:51.34]Fluttershy don't let this end
[02:53.90]No one's a perfect friend
[02:56.47]This burden's not just yours to bear
[02:58.87]You've gotta know your friends are always there
[03:01.60]So come out of the rain~
[03:04.21]We didn't mean to cause this pain~
[03:06.73]Just grab your dreams and don't let go
[03:09.34]They're yours to keep so hold them close
