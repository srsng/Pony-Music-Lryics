[00:48.38]In the end, it was easy for my life to break
[00:56.29]Every choice that I made was another mistake
[01:04.29]But a second chance takes all the world for~ a turn
[01:12.33]One more chance to entrance and to love and to learn
[01:19.67]And woah-oh-oh-woah-oh, the world will be free
[01:23.67]And woah-oh, you'll be~ with me
[01:28.00]I used to wonder what friendship could be
[01:31.71]Now you're here to share it with me-e-e
[01:37.83]This feeling is taking me o~ver
[01:41.67]This feeling that I can't deny
[01:45.83]'Cause through all the pain~ and the crip~pling loss
[01:49.83]It's so good to know I'm alive
[01:53.88]And I won't give in to the sor~row~~
[01:57.88]And I will~ not rest till~ I've won~
[02:01.67]And I'll make a brighter tomor~~ro-o-ow
[02:08.67]And give you the world when I'm done
[02:12.33]And I'll leave you~ the world when I'm done
[02:23.33]Broken hearts can restart, see the light in the skies
[02:31.33]Looking into the truth in the depths of your eyes
[02:39.33]No more sorrow arri~ving~ at some better place
[02:47.33]Finding home in the heart and the smile on your face
[02:54.67]And woah-oh-oh, the world will be free
[02:58.67]And woah-oh-oh-woah-oh, you'll be~ with me
