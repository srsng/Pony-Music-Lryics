In the end, it was easy for my life to break
Every choice that I made was another mistake
But a second chance takes all the world for~ a turn
One more chance to entrance and to love and to learn
And woahohwoahoh, the world will be free
And woahoh, you'll be~ with me
I used to wonder what friendship could be
Now you're here to share it with me
This feeling is taking me o~ver
This feeling that I can't deny
'Cause through all the pain~ and the crip~pling loss
It's so good to know I'm alive
And I won't give in to the sor~row~~
And I will~ not rest till~ I've won~
And I'll make a brighter tomor~~row
And give you the world when I'm done
And I'll leave you~ the world when I'm done
Broken hearts can restart, see the light in the skies
Looking into the truth in the depths of your eyes
No more sorrow arri~ving~ at some better place
Finding home in the heart and the smile on your face
And woahohoh, the world will be free
And woahohwoahoh, you'll be~ with me
I used to wonder what my life could be
Now you're here to share it with me~~
This feeling is taking me o~ver~~
This feeling that I can't deny
'Cause through all the pain and the crip~pling loss
It's so good to know~ I'm~ alive~
And I won't give in to the sor~row~~
And I will~ not rest till~ I've~ won
And I'll make a brighter tomor~~row
And give you the world when I'm done
And I'll leave you the world when I'm done
Ah, ahah, ahah, ah, ah
Ah, ahah, ahah, ahah, ah
Ahahah, ahah, ah, ahah, ah
Ah, ahah, ahah, ahah, ahah, ah, ah, ah
This feeling is taking me o~ver~
This feeling that I will be free
'Cause through all the pain and the weight of~ the world
It's so good to know~ you're~ with me~
This feeling is taking me o~ver~~
This feeling that I can't deny
'Cause through all the pain and~ the crip~pling loss
It's so good to know~ I'm~ alive~
And I won't give in to the sor~row~~
And I will~ not rest till~ I've won
And I'll make a brigh~ter tomor~~row
And give you~ the world when I'm done
And I'll leave you the world when I'm done
