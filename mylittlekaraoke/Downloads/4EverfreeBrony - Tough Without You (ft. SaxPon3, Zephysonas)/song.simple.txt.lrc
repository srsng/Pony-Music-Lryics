I'll be searching day and night
The big old sun, it sure is bright
But it's hard to keep it burning without you
And when the sun is out of sight
The moon will be my guiding light
But it's hard to keep it turning without you
It's hard to keep it turning without you
Summer, winter, spring and fall
Seasons move around us all
But it's hard to keep 'em rolling without you
Seconds keep on passing by
The numbers tell us how and why
But time will never stand still without you
The time will never stand still without you
Guess who I've been thinking of
My little heart is full of love
But it's hard to keep it beating without you
It's hard to keep it beating without you
