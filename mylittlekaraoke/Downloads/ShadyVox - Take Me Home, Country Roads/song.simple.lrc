[00:10.42]Almost heaven, West Virginia
[00:16.25]Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
[00:23.42]Life is old there, older than the trees
[00:28.50]Younger than the mountains, rolling like a breeze
[00:33.58]Country roads, take me home
[00:39.37]To the place I belong
[00:45.17]West Virginia,oh mountain mama-a-a
[00:50.96]Take me home, country roads
[00:58.12]All my memories gather 'round her
[01:03.96]Miner's la~-ady, stranger to blue water
[01:11.17]Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
[01:16.25]Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
[01:21.29]Country roads, take me home
[01:27.08]To the place I belong
[01:32.87]West Virginia,oh mountain mama
[01:38.33]Oh take me home, country roads
[01:45.62]I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me
[01:50.67]The radio reminds me of my home far away
[01:56.67]Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
[02:00.33]That I should've been home yesterday
[02:04.67]Yesterday
[02:07.58]Country roads, take me home
[02:13.33]To the place
[02:16.25]I belong oh! West Virginia
[02:21.71]Oh mountain mama-a-a
[02:24.71]Oh take me home, country roads
[02:30.04]Oh take me home, country roads
[02:36.12]Oh take me home, country roads
