[00:14.45]There's an echo out in the outside world
[00:20.38]There's a whispering in the bre-eeze
[00:26.07]And if you're listening though the fall-i-ing le-eaves
[00:32.23]There's a dre-eam for everythi-ing
[00:38.52]All I've ever wanted is a friend
[00:44.08]So-omeone who understands me-e
[00:47.18]And doesn't just pretend
[00:49.36]And I know they're out there so-omewhere
[00:55.56]Ju-ust waiting to say hello
[01:01.12]And I hear their voice-es ca-alling
[01:07.41]Bu-ut with this fe-ear of e-eyes
[01:10.70]It's a sound I'll never know
[01:25.56]It's another day with the same blue sky
[01:31.49]And the same sunrise of yesterda-ay
[01:37.23]And I'm a distance out from the city-y li-ights
[01:43.34]And I know I shouldn't sta-ay
[01:49.64]All I've ever wanted is a friend
[01:55.19]Someone who understands me-e
[01:58.29]And doesn't just pretend
[02:00.47]And I know they're out there so-omewhere
[02:06.67]Ju-ust waiting to say hello
[02:12.23]And I hear their voice-es ca-alling
[02:18.52]Bu-ut with this fe-ear of eâ€“eyes
[02:21.81]It's a sound I'll never know
[02:28.15]One would think I'd learn
[02:32.55]After the fi-irst time
[02:37.04]Loneliness just hurts
[02:41.49]After a li-ifetime
[02:44.82]And still I~ kno-o-o-ow
[02:50.84]Yes, I know there's someo-one o-out there
[02:57.04]Ju-ust waiting to say hello
[03:02.60]And I hear their voices ca-alling me
[03:10.38]Bu-ut with this fe-ear of eâ€“eyes
[03:13.66]It's a sound I'll never know
[03:21.86]Never kno-o-ow
