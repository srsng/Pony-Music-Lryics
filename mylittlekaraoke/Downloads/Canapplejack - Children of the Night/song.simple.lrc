[00:10.10]I still remember it like it was yesterday,
[00:13.40]though it was countless moons ago
[00:16.50]After he was defeated,
[00:18.60]not much of our once beautiful home was left
[00:21.60]And the two brave ones that stood up for us all
[00:24.20]ruled Equestria from then on
[00:26.65]One day, the younger one, saddened by our daily struggles,
[00:30.15]proposed to form a new colony
[00:32.60]where all of us would grow strong and happy
[00:36.40]But the elder one forbade it,
[00:38.70]for she felt that it would divide and shatter the weakened kingdom
[00:42.20]forever
[00:43.85]Nopony knows that we're still here,
[00:46.10]smiling beneath the moonlight
[00:48.15] while remembering our dear mother,
[00:50.35]for we will forever be...
[00:52.20]her children of the night
[01:17.80]Come little children, I'll take thee away
[01:23.55]Into a land of enchantment
[01:29.30]Come little children, the time's come to play
[01:35.10]Here in my garden of sha-a-adows
[01:52.50]Follow sweet children, I'll show thee the way
[01:58.15]Through all the pain and the sorrows
[02:03.90]Weep not poor children, for life is this way
[02:09.60]Murdering beauty and passions
[02:15.35]Hush now dear children, it must be this way
[02:20.80]Too weary o-of life and deceptio~ns
[03:12.95]Come little children
[03:15.60]I'll take thee away
[03:18.85]Into a land of enchantment
[03:24.60]Come little children
[03:27.10]The time's come to play
[03:30.30]Here in my garden of sha-ado-ows
