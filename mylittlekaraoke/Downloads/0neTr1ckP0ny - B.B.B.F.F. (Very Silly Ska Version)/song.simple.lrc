[00:09.03]When I was just a filly
[00:10.95]I found itrather silly
[00:13.46]To see how many other ponies I could meet
[00:18.02]I had my books to read
[00:19.97]Didn't know that I would ever need
[00:22.25]Other ponies to make my life complete
[00:26.47]But there was one colt that I cared for
[00:29.48]I knew he would be there for me
[00:33.55]My Big Brother Best Friend Forever
[00:38.04]Like two peas in a pod
[00:40.35]We did everything together
[00:43.46]He taught me how to fly a kite
[00:47.98]We never had a single fight
[00:51.92]We shared our hopes, we shared our dreams
[00:57.00]I miss him more than I realized
[01:00.74] I-it seems
[01:03.02]My Big Brother Best Friend Forever
[01:12.04]My Big Brother Best Friend Forever
[01:32.42]My Big Brother Best Friend Forever
[01:36.92]Like two peas in a pod
[01:39.23]We did everything together
[01:42.33]He taught me how to fly a kite
[01:46.86]We never had a single fight
[01:50.79]We shared our hopes, we shared our dreams
[01:55.88]I miss him more than I realized
[01:59.61] I-it seems
[02:01.86]Your Big Brother Best Friend Forever
[02:06.35]Like two peas in a pod
[02:08.67]You did everything together
[02:11.74]And though he's oh so far away
[02:14.58]I hope that he would stay
[02:18.02]My Big Brother Best Friend
[02:22.25]Forever
[02:26.74]Foreve-e-e-er
