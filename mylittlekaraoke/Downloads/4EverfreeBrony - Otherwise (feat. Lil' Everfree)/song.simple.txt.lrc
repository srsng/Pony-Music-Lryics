Head to hoof, I've never been better
Better than I feel now
(Better than I feel now)
Feel my pain, and you'd feel nothing
Nothing can get me down
(Nothing can get me down)
Now I've told a thousand lies before
But you hear truth and nothing more
(Truth and nothing more)
Bring the day, I think I'm ready
Ready to open my door
(Ready to open my door)
Whoaoh
'Cause every step I take outside
Is a sign that I fel alive
I feel alive (I feel alive)
And even if I change my mind
I'm not gonna roll those dice
And no one's told me otherwise (ise)
I'll move like a butterfly (y)
I'm not gonna cover my eyeyeyes (eyeyeyes)
Oh, no one's told me otherwise (ise)
Yeah, no one's told me otherwise, otherwise, otherwise
Otherwise, otherwise, otherwise
Otherwise, otherwise, otherwise
Otherwise, otherwise
Well, I got no reason to worry
Worry myself away
(Worry myself away)
'Cause in the end, I'm in no hurry
Taking my time today
(Taking my time today)
A single route and so much air
And I could break, but I~ won't dare
(Break, but I~ won't dare)
But I'm the only one who knows the meaning of
"handle with care"
(Of "handle with care")
Yeaheyeaheyeah
'Cause every step I take outside
Is a sign that I fel alive
I feel alive (I feel alive)
And even if I change my mind
I'm not gonna roll those dice
And no one's told me otherwise (ise)
I'll move like a butterfly (y)
I'm not gonna cover my eyeyeyes (eyeyeyes)
Oh, no one's told me otherwise (ise)
Yeah, no one's told me otherwise, otherwise, otherwise
Otherwise, otherwise, otherwise
Otherwise, otherwise, otherwise
Otherwise, otherwise
I'll keep singing, no one stop me
I'll keep bringing on this melody
I'll keep singing, no one stop me
I'll keep bringing on this melody
Da, da, dada, da da da da
Da, da, dada, da, da, da
Da, da, dada, da da da da
Da, da, dada, da, da, da
'Cause every step I take outside
Is a sign that I fel alive
I feel alive
And even if I change my mind
I'm not gonna roll those dice
And no one's told me otherwise
Otherwise
Otherwise
