I did some things that I regret
Ohohoh, and it's been hurting like hell in my hands
I wore my flaws upon my sleeve
Ohohoh, I wanna bury my shell in the sand
So I part with my ways
Let 'em wash with the waves
I've been cautious to~ not let my gospel decay
Let tomorrow lead the fray
'Cause my past's not today
'Cause my past's not today~
Watch me turn my back and let the sunset shimmer~, yeah
On the ocean shore, I feel the sunlight glimmer
I've begun my path, headed for something bigger~, oh~ yeah
It's time to let it shine~ and make the magic flicker
Ohoh oh
Ohoh oh
Time to lay my sins to rest
Ohohoh, and let the fires in hell burn my tan
I'll shed my skin with past beliefs
Ohohoh, and then I'll rise up and try this again
So I part with my ways
Let 'em wash with the waves
I've been cautious to not let my gospel decay
Let tomorrow lead the fray
'Cause my past's not today
Reawakened through ages of love, war, and fate
Sunset shims from daylight
Starlight glims through the night
Twilight sparkles through darkness, and everything's alright
Till tomorrow comes, I pray
That my past is not today
'Cause my past's not today
Ohoh oh
Watch me turn my back and let the sunset shimmer~, yeah
On the ocean shore, I feel the sunlight glimmer
I've begun my path, headed for something bigger ~, oh yeah~, oh!
It's time to let it shine and make the magic flicker
