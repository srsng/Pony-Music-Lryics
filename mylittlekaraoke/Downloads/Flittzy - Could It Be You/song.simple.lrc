[00:34.83]Drops of rain out~side the window find a way inside
[00:40.21]My mind is wondering how I came to be
[00:46.37]Everything inside this shadow keeps me paralyzed
[00:51.76]My heart is set on something under~neath~
[00:57.50]The ground is gi~ving way beneath my feet
[01:04.33]I~ can~not say if I'm~ complete~~~~
[01:14.30]Could it be~ you?
[01:15.69]Could it be~ me?
[01:17.13]Could it be the way you hold onto all of these things~~?
[01:22.65]It draws me clo~~ser
[01:25.75]Could it be the winds?
[01:27.24]Could it be the stars?
[01:28.63]Would you ever see it to the end~ of this sto~ry
[01:33.61]Until it drags you under
[01:58.04]A blurry landscape slowly for~ming, focused in~ my eyes
[02:03.61]The sky itself turns liquid as I leap
[02:09.72]Every part of me is sta~ring, trying to get by
[02:15.11]Though I don't know yet what it is I seek~
[02:20.86]The ground is gi~ving way beneath my feet
[02:27.68]I~ can~not say if I'm~ complete~~~~
[02:37.52]Could it be~ love?
[02:39.09]Deep in your~ eyes?
[02:40.48]How could I~ hate the way you go~ about your life~~?
[02:45.96]It draws me clo~~ser
[02:49.11]Could it be the winds?
[02:50.54]Could it be the stars?
[02:51.98]Would you ever wish that you could go back to the start~~
[02:56.97]Until it drags you under
[03:15.02]Could it be~ you?
[03:16.41]Could it be~ me?
[03:17.85]Could it be the way you hold onto all of these things~~?
[03:23.37]It draws me clo~~ser
[03:26.47]Could it be the winds?
[03:27.95]Could it be the stars?
[03:29.35]Would you ever see it to the end~ of this sto~ry
[03:34.33]Until it drags you under
