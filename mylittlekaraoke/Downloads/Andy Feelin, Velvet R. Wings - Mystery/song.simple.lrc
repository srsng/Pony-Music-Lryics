[00:24.39]Who are you the next day
[00:27.05]Well, I can only guess
[00:30.80]You're hiding deep inside from real life and stress
[00:36.73]And I want to understand what makes you who you are
[00:42.95]We'll never let you fall apart
[00:48.74]Let me see your true face
[00:51.35]Behind veil and mask
[00:54.68]Mystery
[00:56.62]That's what you are
[01:00.80]I will hide my true face

[01:06.83]Mystery
[01:08.77]That's not true me

[01:24.72]I cannot read your thoughts
[01:28.52]You act like total stranger when you don't wanna talk
[01:34.41]And I can barely see
[01:37.25]What you need the most
[01:40.53]I would have done anything
[01:43.00]To have you here, so close

[02:08.06]How could you look into my~ mind
[02:14.04]My face is mask and there's nothing be~hind
[02:19.50]My loneliness you cannot break
[02:22.49]My feelings that you cannot fake
[02:25.53]I'll hide again
[02:27.05]I'll run away
[02:28.52]Tomorrow I won't be the~ same
[02:56.24]Let me see your true face
[02:58.95]Behind veil and mask
