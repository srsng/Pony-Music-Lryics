[00:02.12]The world is caught up in its strife
[00:05.74]The Newborn pays its u-unborn life
[00:09.74]Everywhere there's complica-ations
[00:13.43]I'm just left in thought~
[00:16.66]Oh, little dreams
[00:18.97]Little dreams
[00:20.82]Won't you come back and torture me?
[00:24.51]Lovely dreams, happy dre-eams
[00:28.20]Won't you show me what used to be?
[01:00.97]Oh, little dreams
[01:03.28]Little dreams

[02:44.74]Every da-ay I'm cry-ying
[02:48.47]Everything gets on my nerves
[02:52.12]Everypony sta-ares
[02:55.32]And I'm really tired of their wo-ords
[02:59.28]I'm jealous a-and incompetent
[03:03.01]My hopes have all faded fa-ast
[03:06.93]Look insi-ide my broken heart~
[03:10.62]No one could make it la-ast

[04:15.28]Little dreams
[04:17.12]Won't you come back and torture me?
[04:20.82]Lovely dreams, happy dre-eams
[04:24.51]Won't you show me what used to be?
