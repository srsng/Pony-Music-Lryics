The world is caught up in its strife
The Newborn pays its u-unborn life
Everywhere there's complica-ations
I'm just left in thought~
Oh, little dreams
Little dreams
Won't you come back and torture me?
Lovely dreams, happy dre-eams
Won't you show me what used to be?
Oh, little dreams
Little dreams
Won't you come back and torture me?
Lovely dreams, happy dre-eams
Won't you show me what used to be?
Oh, little dreams
Little dreams
Won't you come back and torture me?
Lovely dreams, happy dre-eams
Won't you show me what used to be?
Every da-ay I'm cry-ying
Everything gets on my nerves
Everypony sta-ares
And I'm really tired of their wo-ords
I'm jealous a-and incompetent
My hopes have all faded fa-ast
Look insi-ide my broken heart~
No one could make it la-ast
Oh, little dreams
Little dreams
Won't you come back and torture me?
Lovely dreams, happy dre-eams
Won't you show me what used to be?
Oh, little dreams
Little dreams
Won't you come back and torture me?
Lovely dreams, happy dre-eams
Won't you show me what used to be?
