[00:54.44]I can feel the a-ambience in life
[01:00.49]Lying in the backgrou~nd in silence and igno-orance
[01:06.49]Miracles are found i-in the ballrooms of brave-ery
[01:12.49]Courage is a dange-erous dance
[01:17.98]Woah oh
[01:20.98]Fear is my-y right to-o say "no" woah
[01:27.07]Peace is my-y reason to gro-ow
[01:32.98]Still I~ re-emain here alo-one
[01:39.02]When will I fee~l li-ike I'm home?
[01:54.21]Belonging is a stranger to-o me
[02:00.49]Caught up in a snowstorm of wandering mise-ery
[02:06.44]Staring through a mirro-or, reflections of life a-are seen
[02:12.40]Yet I feel an abse-ence in me
[02:16.62]Woah oh oh woah
[02:20.98]Fear is my-y right to-o say "no" woah
[02:27.02]Peace is my-y reason to gro-ow
[02:32.98]Still I~ re-emain here alo-one
[02:39.02]When will I fee~l li-ike I'm home?
[03:05.08]Oh ooh oh
[03:08.60]How long wi-ill I run from my~self
[03:14.51]How long wi-ill I run from myself
[03:20.46]How long wi-ill I run from myself
[03:29.98]Woah woah
[03:33.02]Fear is my-y right to~ say "no" woah
[03:39.02]Peace is my-y reason to gro-ow
[03:45.02]Still I~ re-emain here alo-one
[03:51.07]When will I fee~l li-ike I'm ho-ome?
[03:57.07]Desti-iny frightens my soul, woah
[04:02.74]And I ne~ver wante-ed to kno-ow
[04:09.02]What lie~s ahead on this roa~d
[04:14.98]When will I fee-eel li-ike I'm home?
