[00:04.14]Good morning, sun
[00:05.33]No time to chat, I gotta run
[00:07.40]'Cause I've got places to be
[00:10.56]So much to do
[00:11.74]Excited, yes, and nervous, too
[00:13.82]A change is starting with me
[00:16.97]I never worry 'bout upsetting carts
[00:19.19]Hardened hearts
[00:20.23]Or wonder, "Will I belong?"
[00:22.80]I've heard it enough
[00:24.42]I'm callin' their bluff
[00:26.00]I'll never get lost in the gre-e-ey
[00:29.21]There's something inside
[00:30.84]Burns bigger than pride
[00:32.47]Shines out of me, lighting the wa-ay
[00:48.45]I've heard it enough
[00:50.08]I'm callin' their bluff
[00:51.66]I'll never get lost in the gre-e-ey
[00:54.87]There's something inside
[00:56.50]Burns bigger than pride
[00:58.08]Shines out of me, lighting the wa-ay
[01:14.21]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be my da-ay
[01:17.42]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna bе my da-ay
[01:20.63]Gonna be, gonna be, gonna bе my da-ay
[01:27.43]Hey there, hello!
[01:28.62]The friends I make, the friends I know
[01:30.59]Today you answer my call
[01:33.85]Instead of hide, instead of staying stuck inside
[01:37.01]Instead of building your wall
[01:40.21]Come on and party with me, join the band, understand
[01:43.42]We'll all be singing this song
[01:46.43]Everyone's afra-aid
[01:49.44]Always ju-udging, never bu-udging
[01:52.94]Ain't it ti-ime we ma-ade the team
[01:58.87]I've heard it enough
[02:00.49]I'm callin' their bluff
[02:02.07]I'll never get lost in the gre-e-ey
[02:05.23]Go big or go home
[02:06.86]Get real or get known
[02:08.44]Get ready and raring to sa-ay
[02:24.47]I've heard it enough
[02:26.10]I'm callin' their bluff
[02:27.68]I'll never get lost in the gre-e-ey
[02:30.89]There's something inside
[02:32.52]Burns bigger than pride
[02:34.10]Shines out of me, lighting the wa-ay
