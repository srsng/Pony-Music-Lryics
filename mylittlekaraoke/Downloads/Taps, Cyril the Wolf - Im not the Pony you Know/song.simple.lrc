[00:33.52]I don't know where to go
[00:37.75]I can't find my way
[00:40.37]The world turns slow
[00:44.18]There is no end to my-y day
[00:47.18]My vision is black
[00:51.46]I am running blind
[00:54.03]There is no turning back
[00:57.89]On the pa-ath I can't find
[01:56.39]I'm sick of people thinking
[01:58.11]I have no mind
[01:59.39]Just 'cause my eyes are out of focus
[02:01.53]Trust me I'm fine
[02:02.82]Don't underestimate
[02:04.32]Anypony can be great
[02:06.25]My advice is to change your opinion
[02:08.66]Before it's too late
[02:09.94]To all of you defending me
[02:11.82]I appreciate your kind words
[02:13.59]But don't be absurd
[02:14.82]I've got experience with the herd
[02:16.53]If you wanna hold on my hooves,
[02:18.30]It'll be gold for the fools
[02:19.91]Who want to box me in
[02:21.52]Keep me out of the tubes
[02:50.61]I don't know where to go
[02:54.89]I can't find my way
[02:57.52]The world turns slow
[03:01.37]There is no end to my-y day
[03:04.37]My vision is black
[03:08.61]I am running blind
[03:11.23]There is no turning back
[03:15.09]On the pa-ath I can't find
