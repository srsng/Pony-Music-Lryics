[00:07.21]I'm not the sort to fall easily in love
[00:11.03]No~, they are few and far between that catch my eyes
[00:16.32]But when she walked up with that smile and "howdy do"
[00:20.44]My~ tongue tied knots I didn't know that it could tie
[00:24.85]She's~ gorgeous, pragma~tic, industrious, and kind
[00:29.85]She down~right ra~diates agrarian allure
[00:35.15]If there was a contest for winsome coun~try class
[00:39.31]There'd be~ a bright blue ribbon headed~ straight to her
[00:45.15]Blonde~, freckled, and green~-eyed
[00:47.50]My~ heart~ is hogtied~
[00:49.85]That~ twang~ is knockin' me~ out~
[00:53.09]Take~ me~, on~ down to your farm~, girl
[00:56.91]Turn~ on your charm, girl
[00:58.72]That countrified~ charisma is what I'm~ all about~
[01:03.38]Uh
[01:15.44]My~, oh~, my, yeah, she's a down~-home Southern saint~
[01:19.85]She tells it like it is~ and won't go say~in' things that ain't
[01:24.85]Sweet as apple cider and~ with spice enough to spare~
[01:29.26]And "I~ won't ever~ want no o~ther," I do~ declare
[01:33.68]There is none~ who holds~ a candle~ on this side of~ anywhere~
[01:47.20]She's not afraid~ of a little sweat and mud
[01:51.08]She's got~ my heart beatin' a stea~dy pitter pat
[01:56.62]No fuss, no pretense, and nary a complaint
[02:00.44]I swear~ she hides~ a halo 'neath that~ stetson hat
[02:06.03]Caring, devo~ted, and level-headed
[02:09.56]And good~ Lord, her baking is a gift from the~ divine
[02:14.85]Oh~, tell~ me that she feels the same~ way~ that I do
[02:19.26]I'll be her sugar~cube, she'll be~ my~ Valentine
[02:25.15]Blonde~, freckled, and green~-eyed
[02:27.50]My~ heart~ is hog~tied~
[02:29.85]That~ twang~ is knockin' me~ out~~
[02:33.09]Take~ me~, on~ down to your farm~~, girl
[02:36.91]Turn~ on your charm, girl
[02:38.68]That coun~trified~ charisma is what I'm~~ all about~
[02:43.09](Whoo!)
[02:43.68]My~, oh~, my, yeah, she's~ a down~-home Southern saint~
[02:48.09]She tells it like it is~ and won't go say~in'~ things that ain't
[02:53.09]Sweet as ap~ple cider and with spice enough to spare~
[02:57.50]And "I~ won't ever~ want no other," I do~~ declare
[03:01.91]There is none~ who holds~ a candle on this side~ of anywhere~
[03:08.09]No~, no~~~~
[03:54.41]Yeah~
[03:55.44]My~, oh~, my, girl's~ a down~-home South~ern saint~
[03:59.85]She tells it like it is and~ won't go sayin' things that ain't
[04:04.26](Oh~) Sweet~ as apple~~ cider and with spice enough to spare~
[04:09.26]And "I~ won't ever~ want no ot~her," I~ do~ declare~~~~
[04:15.24]There~ is none~ who holds a can~dle~ on this side~ of a-a-a-a-a-a-any
