They can be plain or fancy
They can be short or long
The simple white kind
The glowbynight kind
With socks you can't go wrong
A gift as good as candy
A big balloon or blocks
They always come in handy
And nothin' says Christmas like a pair of socks!
When winter
Is turning your nosey
A litle bit frozey
Socks'll make you feel
Comfy cozy
Who doesn't love to wear them?
No one at all, that's who!
The sparkly red kind, the weartobed kind
It's nice to have a fewI know I do
Some folks enjoy new mittens
Or a teddy bear that talks
Or a picture book of kittens
But nothin' says Christmas, merry merry Christmas
Nothin' says Christmas like a pair of socks!
