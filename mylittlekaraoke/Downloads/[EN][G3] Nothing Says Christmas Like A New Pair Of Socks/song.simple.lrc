[00:09.62]They can be plain or fancy
[00:13.93]They can be short or long
[00:18.17]The simple white kind
[00:20.29]The glow-by-night kind
[00:22.41]With socks you can't go wrong
[00:26.78]A gift as good as candy
[00:31.02]A big balloon or blocks
[00:35.32]They always come in handy
[00:39.10]And nothin' says Christmas like a pair of socks!
[00:43.07]When winter
[00:46.52]Is turning your nose-y
[00:50.89]A lit-tle bit froze-y
[00:54.73]Socks'll make you feel
[00:58.97]Comfy cozy
[01:01.02]Who doesn't love to wear them?
[01:05.33]No one at all, that's who!
[01:09.57]The sparkly red kind, the wear-to-bed kind
[01:13.87]It's nice to have a fewI know I do
[01:18.25]Some folks enjoy new mittens
[01:22.15]Or a teddy bear that talks
[01:26.39]Or a picture book of kittens
[01:30.43]But nothin' says Christmas, merry merry Christmas
[01:35.01]Nothin' says Christmas like a pair of socks!
