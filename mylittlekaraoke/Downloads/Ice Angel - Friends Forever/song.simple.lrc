[00:15.25]What is this thing we call emotion?
[00:19.00]Can it be brought into the light?
[00:22.75]Where is it now? Is it on vacation?
[00:26.50]Can someone help me out of my mind?
[00:30.29]So many memories are jumbled and twisted
[00:34.00]Crossed out the faces, and let go of friends
[00:37.75]The line is slender between death and sadness
[00:41.46]I've~ seen it over and over again
[00:45.25]No more to this one, and no more to that one
[00:49.00]Some thoughts are smeared~ with a canvas of black
[00:52.71]I'm~ not ashamed~ of the pieces I'm missing
[00:56.50]They're not much to~ la-a-a-a-ack
[01:00.25]The shadow clouds our sight
[01:02.12]But we know that, to light,
[01:04.00]The dark will surren~der
[01:07.75]So let us not forget
[01:09.62]Of all the good we met
[01:11.73]We~ will~ remember
[02:00.25]Wonderful times or painful reflections
[02:04.04]Confusing thoughts are plain as can be
[02:07.79]It's all a maze of endless directions
[02:11.50]But who said happiness would be free?
[02:15.29]Sometimes I feel afraid, of all the memories ma-ade
[02:19.00]And how~ they'll~ remind~ me
[02:22.79]But I guess that's okay, 'cause I know that one day~
[02:26.50]You'll come~ ba-ack to fi-ind me~
[02:32.59]And once aga-a-ain
[02:39.62]Oooh, I lose~ a frie-e-e-end
[02:45.29]The faces come and go
[02:49.04]They take a toll on~ knowing how~
[02:52.75]They'll all be gone one day
[02:56.50]Yet nothin' seems~ to slow me down~
[03:00.25]The shadow clouds our sight
[03:02.12]But we know that, to light,
[03:04.00]The dark will surren~der
[03:07.75]So let us not forget
[03:09.62]Of all the good we met
[03:11.77]We will~ remember
