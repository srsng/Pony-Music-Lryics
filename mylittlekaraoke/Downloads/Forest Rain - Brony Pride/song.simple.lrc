[00:28.30]When I was just sixteen
[00:30.75]I had a car that was lean and mean~
[00:33.73]Put Dashie in my window
[00:36.15]Was the coolest thing I'd seen
[00:39.39]But these kids from down the road~
[00:42.59]They were rather cold~
[00:44.87]I found my Dashie lay in pieces
[00:48.16]Broken and alone
[00:52.07]But I had my group of friends~
[00:54.79]Who would defend me to the end~~
[00:59.13]And we picked up every piece and tried
[01:01.94]To make her whole again
[01:05.84]'Cause toge~ther we can do it
[01:09.00]Overcome our fears and doubts
[01:11.72]Though everypony loves~ to shun us
[01:14.83]Together we stand proud
[01:17.11]Hoof in hoof we all will weather
[01:20.53]The storm~ and the~ hate
[01:23.12]'Cause as long as we're together
[01:26.15]We're better off this way
[01:28.56]We've got brony pride~ forever
[01:35.80]Well it wasn't long thereafter
[01:38.82]I went to my first con
[01:41.45]Had a lot of new~ adventures
[01:44.00]And I had a lot of fun
[01:46.98]I spent a weekend in~ a world
[01:49.96]Much different from my own
[01:52.77]And I learned a million things about
[01:55.45]The ponies from the show
[01:59.66]But when I had to say~ goodbye~
[02:02.81]The tears fell from my eyes~
[02:06.89]But I forced a smile and turned away
[02:09.44]And said I think I'll be alright
[02:13.60]'Cause toge~ther we can do it
[02:16.76]Overcome our fears and doubts
[02:19.48]Though everypony loves~ to shun us
[02:22.59]Together we stand~ proud
[02:24.92]Hoof in hoof we all will weather
[02:28.30]The storm~ and the~ hate

[02:46.63]Still got Dashie by my side~~

[02:56.10]And many years~ from now
[02:58.95]Gonna sit my children down~~
[03:02.29]And tell them all about~
[03:04.39]These amazing~~ times
