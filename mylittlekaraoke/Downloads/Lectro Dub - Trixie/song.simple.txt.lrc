A young magician
With strong ambition
She's dedicated
Underrated
But she plans to change
She met her idol
Talked for a while
She learned his trick
She was picked
To go out on stage
Oooh
Oooh
She got caught up in the fame
Proudly shouting out her name
Took her years, now she finally had a crowd to entertain
Hooves were stomping on the floor
Screaming, shouting for encore
Trixie got her attention and desired for more
Oooh
Oooh
A month of touring
Her shows were boring
Without a name
Dipped in fame
Not a soul would care
Her constant fading
Was irritating
This false direction
Of attention
Just felt so unfair
Oooh
Oooh
Then she got to Ponyville
Lying nearly got her killed
She was showed up by a mage who greatly triumphed her in skill
Left with nothing but a name
Fueled with hatred by her shame
She destroyed her reputation and then everything else
Oooh
Oooh
