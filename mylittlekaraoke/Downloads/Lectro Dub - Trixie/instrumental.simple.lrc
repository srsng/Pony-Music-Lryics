[00:02.66]A young magician
[00:05.10]With strong ambition
[00:07.46]She's dedicated
[00:09.00]Underrated
[00:10.12]But she pla-ans to change
[00:12.30]She met her idol
[00:14.66]Talked for a while
[00:17.10]She learned his tri-ick
[00:18.60]She was pi-icked
[00:19.84]To go out on stage
[00:21.64]Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo-ooh
[00:31.20]Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo-ooh
[00:40.16]She got caught up in the fame
[00:42.56]Proudly shouting out her name
[00:45.00]Took her ye-ears, now she finally had a crowd to entertain
[00:49.80]Hooves were stomping on the floor
[00:52.20]Screaming, shouting for encore
[00:54.56]Trixie got her attention and desired for more
[01:19.27]Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo-ooh
[01:28.83]Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo-ooh
[01:38.70]A month of touring
[01:41.10]Her shows were boring
[01:43.50]Without a na-ame
[01:45.00]Dipped in fa-ame
[01:46.16]Not a soul would care
[01:48.26]Her constant fading
[01:50.70]Was irritating
[01:53.13]This false direction
[01:54.56]Of attention
[01:55.76]Just felt so unfair
[01:57.63]Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo-ooh
[02:07.20]Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo-ooh
[02:16.20]Then she got to Ponyville
[02:18.56]Lying nearly got her killed
[02:21.00]She was showed up by a mage who greatly triumphed her in skill
[02:25.76]Left with nothing but a name
[02:28.20]Fueled with hatred by her shame
[02:30.60]She destroyed her reputation and then everything else
[02:55.27]Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo-ooh
[03:04.87]Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo-ooh
