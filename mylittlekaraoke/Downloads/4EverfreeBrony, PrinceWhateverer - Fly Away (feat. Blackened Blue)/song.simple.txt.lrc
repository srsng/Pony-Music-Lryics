I thought we would hit it off so well
But you keep me guessing
I knew not where your recklessness would dwell
And you're still not listening
Your order's way too tall
And you think you've got it all
Well, I'm not gonna break your fall this time
Let's see how far you climb
So here's what I'm trying to say
I'll let you fly away
And don't you dare come back
You made a big mistake
So leave while you still can
Before my patience fades
Now this is your last chance
I'll let you fly away
And don't you dare come back
I know, you try to keep me on the ground
'Cause you're scared of your limits
If you, can't keep up you should stay down
'Cause I'm in it to win it
You'll try to take it all
I'll watch you rise and fall
You dare to take my wings
How well can you fly in lightning
I guess I'll see you around
I'll watch you fly away
Glide on to calmer skies
You've made your last mistake
So you can watch while I
Fly on, through storm and rain
I'll bear the pain, and I'll
Become, the Wonderbolt that
you could never be
I'll watch you fly away
And I'll finally rest my case
Back out and fold your cards
You weren't born to play this part
So, fly away
Just fly away,
or you're gonna crash
I'll watch you fly away
And don't you dare come back
