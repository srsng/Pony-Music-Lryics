[00:51.30]Memories
[00:53.65]Of them making fun of me~
[00:57.30]I don't want to feel their ridicule aga-ain
[01:03.50]But I will overcome
[01:06.30]The worry of disappointing everyone
[01:10.60]I'll fly fearlessly through the wi-i-ind
[01:17.30]I'll take to the ski-i-ies
[01:20.90]Spread my wings and soar
[01:22.90]I refuse to let my fear of failure control me anymore
[01:29.70]Flying faster, soaring thro-ough
[01:33.00]Knowing I have nothing to lose~
[01:36.00]I'm doing what I know is right~
[01:38.90]I'm conquering the fear of flight
[01:55.30]Flying through
[01:57.50]The wind and I know what to do~
[02:01.10]I have to overcome the doubt fill~ing my mi-ind
[02:07.90]So here I go
[02:10.70]I have my friends cheering~ below
[02:13.90]I'll throw uncertainty aside~ as I leave the gro-ound
[02:21.30]I'll take to the ski-i-ies
[02:24.90]Spread my wings and soar
[02:26.90]I refuse to let my fear of failure control me anymore
[02:33.70]Flying faster, soaring thro-ough
[02:36.90]Knowing I have nothing to lose~
[02:40.00]I'm doing what I know is right~
[02:42.90]I'm conquering the fear of flight
[03:24.90]Back for more
[03:26.50]I will soar
[03:28.50]Not fearing failure anymore
[03:31.30]Flying high
[03:32.90]Through the sky
[03:35.30]Feeling so alive~
[03:37.70]Not ashamed
[03:39.10]I'm making a change
[03:41.10]Feeling the wind in my ma-ane
