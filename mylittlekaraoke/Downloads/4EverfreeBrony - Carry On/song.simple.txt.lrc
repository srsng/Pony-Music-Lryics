I felt so broken
When I lost my faith one day
Like a pot knocked over, made out of clay
And it hurt so bad my chest locked up
The pain made me go into shock
It felt like losing someone I love
The fragile feathers taken from this dove
Oh~, but I knew~ I must carry~ on
The pain will fade as I~ moved along
In the hearts that are loyally strong
Faith will al~ways flutter on
Not by the blind submission to rulers and kings
But the bond we share, like two birds of a wing
We must learn to hover on
From all the careless damage that we've done
Carry on
Live to sing another song
The rising sun
Is shining bright for every~one
Carry~ on
Live prosperous and long
One tends to wonder
What the future has in store
When the past won't give out, joy any~more
And I just keep faking every smile
I walk another pointless mile
I don't know when my sorrow will cease
For all I know~ it's just another piece
Oh~, but I know~ I must carry~ on
The pain will fade as I move along
In the hearts that are loyally strong
Faith will~ always...
Carry on
Live to sing another song
The rising sun
Is shining bright for every~one
Carry on
Be~ the change you want to~ see
You're on~ly one
It all comes down to what you believe
Carry~ on
Be valiant and carry~ on
Live prosperous and long
