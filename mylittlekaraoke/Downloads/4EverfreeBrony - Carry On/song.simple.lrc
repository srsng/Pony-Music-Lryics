[00:13.41]I felt so-o bro-oken
[00:17.25]When I lost my fa-aith one day
[00:20.37]Like a po-ot knocked over, made out o-of clay
[00:26.65]And it hurt so bad my chest lo-ocked u-up
[00:30.17]The pain made me-e go into sho-ock
[00:33.41]It felt like losing someone I love
[00:36.65]The fragile fea-athers ta-aken from thi-is do-ove
[00:41.65]Oh~, but I knew~ I must ca-arry~ on
[00:46.21]The pa-ain will fa-ade as I~ moved along
[00:49.25]In the he-earts that are loyally stro-ong
[00:52.81]Faith will al~ways flutter o-on
[00:57.85]Not by the blind submission to rulers and kings
[01:01.21]But the bond we sha-are, like two birds of a wing
[01:04.85]We must le-earn to ho-ove-er on
[01:07.73]From all the ca-areless da-amage that we've do-one
[01:14.45]Ca-arry o-on
[01:17.65]Live to si-ing anothe-er song
[01:20.41]The ri-i-ising su-un
[01:23.81]Is shi-ining bri-ight for every~o-o-one
[01:27.21]Carry~ o-o-o-on
[01:31.65]Live pro-osperous and long
[01:45.25]One tends to wo-onder
[01:49.25]What the future ha-as in store
[01:52.41]When the past won't give out, joy any~more
[01:58.61]And I just keep faking every smi-ile
[02:02.21]I walk ano-other pointless mile
[02:05.33]I don't know whe-en my sorrow will cease
[02:08.69]For all I know~ it's just anothe-er pie-ece
[02:13.57]Oh~, but I know~ I must ca-arry~ on
[02:18.21]The pain will fade as I move along
[02:21.21]In the he-earts that are loyally stro-ong
[02:24.81]Fa-aith will~ a-a-alwa-a-ays...
[02:28.05]Ca-arry o-on
[02:31.25]Li-ive to si-ing anothe-er song
[02:34.05]The ri-i-ising su-un
[02:37.21]Is shi-ining bri-ight for every~o-one
[02:40.85]Ca-arry o-on
[02:44.05]Be~ the cha-ange you want to~ see
[02:46.85]You're on~ly o-one
[02:50.05]It all comes do-own to what you belie-eve
[02:53.65]Carry~ o-o-o-on
[02:58.05]Be va-aliant and ca-arry~ o-o-o-o-o-o-on
[03:04.41]Live pro-osperous and lo-ong
