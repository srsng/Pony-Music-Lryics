[00:55.87]You cannot see
[01:00.19]But your heart is pure
[01:05.01]I know you fe-eel tra-apped
[01:09.34]In a da-ark world
[01:13.91]Some brush you o-off
[01:18.76]And ca-all yo-ou weak
[01:23.09]But your na-ame i-is Snowdrop
[01:27.62]One day the-ey'll se-ee
[01:31.05]If you hold fast and sta-a-and strong
[01:35.62]You'll discover who you are
[01:40.16]If you listen to the world at night
[01:44.73]You can hear the twinkling stars
[01:49.30]If you use love to guide your heart
[01:54.19]You're bo-ound to go-o fa-ar
[01:58.19]You have the po-ower to change the world
[02:02.48]Being uniquely who-o you a-are
[02:45.62]You ca-anno-ot se-ee
[02:49.87]But your mi-ind i-is su-ure
[02:54.73]I know you fe-eel sick
[02:59.05]When there's no-o cu-ure
[03:03.62]Some brush you o-off
[03:07.91]With wo-ords to clip yo-our wi-ings
[03:13.05]But you have to know this
[03:17.62]So I-I'm he-ere to sing
[03:20.76]If you hold fast and sta-a-and strong
[03:25.34]You'll discover who you are
[03:29.87]If you listen to the world at night
[03:34.44]You can hear the twinkling stars
[03:39.01]If you use love to guide your heart
[03:43.91]You're bo-ound to go-o fa-ar
[03:47.91]You have the po-ower to change the world
[03:52.19]Being uniquely who-o you a-are
