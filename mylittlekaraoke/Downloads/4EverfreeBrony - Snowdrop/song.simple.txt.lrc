You cannot see
But your heart is pure
I know you fel trapped
In a dark world
Some brush you off
And call you weak
But your name is Snowdrop
One day they'll se
If you hold fast and stand strong
You'll discover who you are
If you listen to the world at night
You can hear the twinkling stars
If you use love to guide your heart
You're bound to go far
You have the power to change the world
Being uniquely who you are
You cannot se
But your mind is sure
I know you fel sick
When there's no cure
Some brush you off
With words to clip your wings
But you have to know this
So I'm here to sing
If you hold fast and stand strong
You'll discover who you are
If you listen to the world at night
You can hear the twinkling stars
If you use love to guide your heart
You're bound to go far
You have the power to change the world
Being uniquely who you are
