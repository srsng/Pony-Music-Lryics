[00:52.15]As fa-ar as the e-eye ca-an see
[00:59.56]A-all e-eyes are o-o-on me
[01:06.59]They think I~ have what the-ey need
[01:13.81]But how can I~ answer every plea?
[01:20.12]The-ey te-ell me "He-e-ey,
[01:23.28]can't you see that we're hu-urting?"
[01:27.56]"You got the a-answer, cure all the ca-a-ancer
[01:30.95]within our ho-omes"
[01:34.33]What should I sa-a-a-ay?
[01:37.71]There's no perfect solu-ution
[01:41.78]I end up decla-aring something tempora-ary
[01:45.61]Because I'm no-o-ot allowed to~ say "I don't know"
[01:57.38]One million vo-oices all a-at once
[02:04.56]They all say I~ ha-ave what everyo-o-one wants
[02:11.55]And I he-ear so-ome say that I have it a-all
[02:18.77]And ye-et I ca-an't answer every call
[02:25.08]The-ey te-ell me "He-e-ey,
[02:28.24]can't you see that we're hu-urting?"
[02:32.53]"You got the a-answer, cure all the ca-a-ancer
[02:35.91]within our ho-omes"
[02:39.29]What should I sa-a-a-ay?
[02:42.68]There's no perfect solu-ution
[02:46.74]I end up decla-aring something tempora-ary
[02:50.57]Because I'm no-o-ot allowed to~ say
[02:53.96]I'm one of yo-o-o-ou, I'm no one spe-e-cial
[03:01.62]But my shi-iny cro-own convinced you otherwise
[03:08.17]I wish they kne-e-e-ew, my situa-ation~
[03:16.06]I'm an o-ordina-ary nothing in disguise
[03:24.03]"He-ey, can't you see that we're hu-urting?"
[03:30.27]"You got the a-answer, cure all the ca-a-ancer
[03:33.65]within our ho-omes"
[03:37.04]What should I sa-a-a-ay?
[03:40.42]There's no perfect solu-ution
[03:44.48]I end up decla-aring something tempora-ary
[03:48.32]Because I'm no-o-ot allowed to~ say "I don't know"
