As far as the eye can see
Aall eyes are on me
They think I~ have what they need
But how can I~ answer every plea?
They tell me "Hey,
can't you see that we're hurting?"
"You got the answer, cure all the cancer
within our homes"
What should I say?
There's no perfect solution
I end up declaring something temporary
Because I'm not allowed to~ say "I don't know"
One million voices all at once
They all say I~ have what everyone wants
And I hear some say that I have it all
And yet I can't answer every call
They tell me "Hey,
can't you see that we're hurting?"
"You got the answer, cure all the cancer
within our homes"
What should I say?
There's no perfect solution
I end up declaring something temporary
Because I'm not allowed to~ say
I'm one of you, I'm no one special
But my shiny crown convinced you otherwise
I wish they knew, my situation~
I'm an ordinary nothing in disguise
"Hey, can't you see that we're hurting?"
"You got the answer, cure all the cancer
within our homes"
What should I say?
There's no perfect solution
I end up declaring something temporary
Because I'm not allowed to~ say "I don't know"
