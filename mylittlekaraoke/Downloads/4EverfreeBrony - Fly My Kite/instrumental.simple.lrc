[00:23.57]My~ eyes~ are sparkling with wo-onder
[00:29.07]The world is bright and full of life
[00:34.52]My fri-iend is moving on
[00:36.70]The only one I had is gone
[00:39.38]So, I'll just fly my kite
[00:45.43]My si-ight is blinded by illu-usions
[00:50.89]I'm doing what I fe-eel is right
[00:56.39]If I~ could have my way
[00:58.52]We'd look and act and think the same
[01:01.16]But I'd~ sti-ill fly my kite
[01:31.80]My mi-ind is clouded up with ha-atred
[01:37.25]I won't go do-own without~ a fight
[01:42.71]My~ hi-istory's a dump
[01:45.09]Wish that I~ could change it up
[01:47.48]But I'd~ sti-ill fly my kite
[01:52.25]In many wa-ays
[01:55.32]I~ will a-always be-e ashamed
[01:58.05]Of the da-ays
[02:00.82]I had ye-et to fi-ind my way
[02:03.50]You could sa-ay
[02:06.23]I will ne-ever be-e the sa-ame
[02:08.96]But-ut some thi-ings never cha-ange
[02:18.16]My~ he-eart is burdened with confu-usion
[02:23.62]I thought I knew my destiny
[02:29.07]My li-ife is made of flaws
[02:31.29]And yet you o~verlook them all
[02:33.84]So, won't yo-ou fly with me
[02:39.30]Come fly yo-our kite with me
[03:06.57]Come fly yo-our kite with me
