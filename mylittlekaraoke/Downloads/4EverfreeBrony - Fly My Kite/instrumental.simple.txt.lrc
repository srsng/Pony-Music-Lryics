My~ eyes~ are sparkling with wonder
The world is bright and full of life
My friend is moving on
The only one I had is gone
So, I'll just fly my kite
My sight is blinded by illusions
I'm doing what I fel is right
If I~ could have my way
We'd look and act and think the same
But I'd~ still fly my kite
My mind is clouded up with hatred
I won't go down without~ a fight
My~ history's a dump
Wish that I~ could change it up
But I'd~ still fly my kite
In many ways
I~ will always be ashamed
Of the days
I had yet to find my way
You could say
I will never be the same
But some things never change
My~ heart is burdened with confusion
I thought I knew my destiny
My life is made of flaws
And yet you o~verlook them all
So, won't you fly with me
Come fly your kite with me
Come fly your kite with me
