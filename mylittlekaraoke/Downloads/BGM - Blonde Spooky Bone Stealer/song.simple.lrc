[00:03.77]It happened long ago
[00:08.06]On a night just like tonight
[00:12.34]Within this very forest
[00:16.56]Beneath a full moon's light
[00:20.77]She's called a necromancer
[00:25.06]But what she does is worse
[00:29.27]For death she does not bring
[00:33.31]But instead eternal curse
[00:39.63]She hides within the forest, the sunlight is her bane
[00:43.02]She travels on these pathways looking out for easy prey
[00:46.45]If you are so unlucky, you'll meet her face to face
[00:49.95]And if you don't act quickly then you surely won't escape
[00:53.34]You'll find yourself enveloped, and unable to move
[00:56.73]You're caught within her magic and now surely you are doomed
[01:00.20]Her eyes will flare up brightly the spell is now complete
[01:03.41]And before you stands your skeleton as you're a blob of meat
[01:07.31]Blonde Spooky Bone Stealer, monster that you are
[01:10.45]Your actions are unnerving, your motives are bizarre
[01:14.16]Blonde Spooky Bone Stealer in the Everfree
[01:17.34]She wants to steal the skeleton inside of you and me
[01:35.27]Uh-huh, sure
[01:36.59]Now hold on, girls
[01:37.70]There might be something to this
[01:39.34]Pinkie!
[01:39.98]Yes, hear me out!
[01:41.56]Fairytales are fleeting, and rumors come and go
[01:44.77]Not every story's meaningless and surely we should know
[01:48.20]That stories have a reason, causation and a source
[01:51.63]And just what are you saying?
[01:53.34]Well that she's real, of course!
[01:55.06]I know it may seem crazy, but what if Pinkie's right?
[01:58.48]This forest, after all, is home to many evil frights~
[02:01.91]If she is truly out there, and wants to steal our bones
[02:05.31]Then we must stand together, and not run off alone
[02:08.77]Now hold it right there mister!
[02:10.52]Your words are falling short
[02:12.23]This pony's just a rumor
[02:13.98]A claim with no support!
[02:15.70]And if this mare were re-al
[02:17.34]Then somepony would say
[02:19.09]Unless she's so efficient
[02:20.73]Nopony gets away
[02:22.81]It's gonna take more than THAT to scare us
[02:25.34]Right, girls?
[02:26.27]Why is she doing this?
[02:27.70]I'm so glad you asked
[02:29.34]She seeks to build an army, of spooky scary bones
[02:32.81]A skeleton battalion, that's under her control
[02:36.20]And if she gets the numbers, Equestria is next
[02:39.66]And ponykind will falter as the skeletons oppress
[02:43.09]She stumbles and she shambles, along these very paths
[02:46.52]Awaiting further victims, to fall within her grasp
[02:49.95]If you go out alone, you may end up her prey
[02:53.38]"But how do we avoid her?"
[02:54.84]Well for that you simply say
[02:56.98]Blonde Spooky Bone Stealer stay you far away
[03:00.23]Begone with your subjection, or face the light of day
[03:03.84]Blonde Spooky Bone Stealer don't you dare pursue
[03:07.06]And curse you down to Tartarus for what you try to do
[03:24.59]Oh come on, girls
[03:25.34]You can't honestly be buying this
[03:27.09]There she is! Aaah!
[03:28.45]Oh wait, no, that was just a falling leaf
[03:30.45]Oopsie!
[03:31.06]Well I've heard all I need to, and I'm for one convinced
[03:34.52]The Bone Stealer is out here and she'll bag us in a cinch
[03:37.95]She's preying on us ponies, and what she does is wrong
[03:41.34]And she can't be a rumor if she has her own so-ong!
[03:44.73]I've met some real bad apples, that'd make the lesser shake
[03:48.20]But she's so diabolical she just might take the cake
[03:51.66]And if you ain't just lyin', she's evil through and through
[03:55.06]Somepony needs to stop her now and that's the honest truth
[03:58.73]Blonde Spooky Bone Stealer stay you far away
[04:01.91]Begone with your subjection, or face the light of day
[04:05.59]Blonde Spooky Bone Stealer don't you dare pursue
[04:08.81]And curse you down to Tartarus for what you try to do
[04:12.41]Blonde Spooky Bone Stealer stay you far away
[04:15.66]Begone with your subjection, or face the light of day
[04:19.31]Blonde Spooky Bone Stealer don't you dare pursue
[04:22.52]And curse you down to Tartarus for what you try to do
