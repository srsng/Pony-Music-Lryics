They call me Ditzy Doo
Good morning, how are you?
I'm Ditzy Doo!
I have two funny eyes
They also call me Bright Eyes
But that's not my real name
My real name is Derpy Hooves
A pleasure meeting you!
I deliver all the mail
They tell me I'm a bother
But I know I'm getting better
I'll show you what I~ mean
And you can tell me if you think
I'm being careful with the mail
I don't remember street names
'Cause I go by faces
Sometimes I'm late for work
Because quite often I
Lock myself in from outside
I'll keep searching for the door key
'Til I see the open window
Some day somepony else besides me will
Call me by my real name they will
Call me Derpy Hooves
Good morning, how are you?
I'm Derpy Hooves
I have two funny eyes
They also call me Bright Eyes
But that's not my real name
My real name is Derpy Hooves
A pleasure meeting you!
I deliver all the mail
They tell me I'm a bother but I know I'm getting better
I'll show you what I know
And you can tell me if you think
I'm being careful with the mail
My real name is Derpy
But they call me Ditzy Doooooooooooooooooooooooo!
