[00:48.76][P1] I saw you kicking apple trees
[00:54.73][P1] I wondered why
[00:56.76][P1] The apples fell, but not the leaves
[01:04.76][P1] I came to you, my voice was soft
[01:05.01][P2] ...came to you, my voice was soft
[01:09.51][P1] You asked, "Is there something wrong?"
[01:09.51][P2] You asked, "Is there something wrong?"
[01:12.98][P1] "Yes" I said, but "No" I thought
[01:12.98][P2] "Yes" I said, but "No" I thought
[01:20.01][P1] Hold you close to me
[01:20.01][P2] Hold you close to me
[01:23.76][P1] The apple of my eye~
[01:23.76][P2] The apple of my eye
[01:28.01][P1] Just give me a chance
[01:28.01][P2] Just give me a chance
[01:31.48][P1] And together we will lie
[01:31.48][P2] And together we will lie
[01:36.01][P1] Underneath the trees
[01:36.01][P2] Underneath the trees
[01:39.76][P1] Wind blowing overhead
[01:39.76][P2] Wind blowing overhead
[01:43.98][P1] Knowing how we feel
[01:43.98][P2] Knowing how we feel
[01:47.73][P1] So nothing more is said
[01:47.73][P2] So nothing more is said
[02:24.73][P1] You saw me looking at the sky
[02:30.76][P1] You asked me how
[02:33.01][P1] How it felt to really fly
[02:40.73][P1] I'd take you there, up off the ground
[02:40.98][P2] ...take you there, up off the ground
[02:45.48][P1] But I like it here
[02:45.48][P2] But I like it here
[02:49.01][P1] Here has you, and you I've found
[02:49.01][P2] Here has you, and you I've found
[02:55.98][P1] Hold you close to me
[02:55.98][P2] Hold you close to me
[02:59.76][P1] The apple of my eye~

[03:11.98][P1] Underneath the trees
[03:11.98][P2] Underneath the trees
[03:15.73][P1] Wind blowing overhead

[03:19.98][P1] Knowing how we feel
[03:19.98][P2] Knowing how we feel
[03:23.73][P1] So nothing more is said
[03:23.73][P2] So nothing more is said
[03:27.98][P1] Knowing how we feel

[04:58.79][P1] You asked me if I feel alone
[04:59.04][P2] ...asked me if I feel alone
[05:05.01][P1] On the ground
[05:05.01][P2] On the ground
[05:06.76][P1] If I have you, I'm right at home
[05:06.98][P2] ...I have you, I'm right at home
