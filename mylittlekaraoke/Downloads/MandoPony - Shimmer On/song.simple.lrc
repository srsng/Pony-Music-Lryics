[00:00.32]And now
[00:02.33]It's all over now
[00:05.89]The sparkle is gone
[00:08.30]See me shimmer o-on
[00:13.52]It's all over now
[00:17.11]The sparkle is gone
[00:19.53]See me shimmer on--
[00:22.33]Imma tell you how it began
[00:24.09]Just so you understand
[00:25.32]This ain't at all what I had wanted
[00:26.89]And it's not what I had planned
[00:28.30]And when I make demands
[00:29.70]Your attention I expect
[00:31.11]All I wanted was respect
[00:32.51]But I just couldn't connect
[00:33.91]With the one who said she'd give me
[00:35.32]Everything I ever wanted
[00:36.89]Imagine seein' all your dreams
[00:38.47]Waved and being flaunted
[00:39.53]Right in front of your face
[00:40.75]And now you're called a disgrace
[00:42.16]I chase her down to get the crown and
[00:43.74]Take control of this place
[00:45.18]This ain't my home, I'm cold, broken, alone
[00:47.60]No one really knows who I am
[00:49.18]But I can't start to show
[00:50.58]Who I've grown into
[00:51.81]Something new, I slowly realize
[00:53.56]I'm becoming a monster,
[00:55.14]And now I fantasize about
[00:56.72]Getting her back
[00:57.60]I track her down, and it's whack
[00:59.00]Imma find that newbie's head
[01:00.58]Smack it down 'til it cracks
[01:01.98]Man, I swear I'd take it back
[01:03.39]Take the life that was mine
[01:04.79]See me shimmer, see me shine
[01:06.19]But you're running out of time
[01:07.60]And now
[01:09.66]It's all over now
[01:13.17]The sparkle is gone
[01:15.62]See me shimmer o-on
[01:20.89]It's all over now
[01:24.44]The sparkle is gone
[01:26.89]See me shimmer o-on
[01:30.75]Now it seems your ears are open, now you'll look my way
[01:33.39]You send your precious protégé to come and save the day
[01:36.19]You never tried to listen to a word I had to say
[01:39.00]And so forget it, it's over, never gonna see me sway
[01:41.81]I stand firm on the ground, no sound from me complainin'
[01:44.79]I'm the king of the storms, no one escapes my reignin'
[01:47.42]You're washed up, your friends are all ashamed
[01:49.70]'Cause your magic ain't nothin' next to what I'm conjurin' today
[01:53.04]Who would'a thought, you'd be caught, you'd be brought
[01:55.32]To your knees, now get shot, thanks a lot
[01:57.42]'Cause I fought for everything that I got
[01:59.88]Here you are, thinking you can instantaneously
[02:02.33]Take it right on the spot? Hah
[02:04.44]Imma teach a lesson that you wish you could forget
[02:07.07]You're gonna wish that you had never been the teacher's pet
[02:09.88]I gave up all my friends, just to see how far I'd get
[02:12.68]They say it's lonely at the top, I don't miss 'em yet
[02:15.36]Now, it's all over now
[02:20.58]The sparkle is gone
[02:22.99]See me shimmer o-on
[02:28.25]It's all over now
[02:31.81]The sparkle is gone
[02:34.26]See me shimmer o-on
[02:37.77]Anything you can do, I can do better
[02:40.58]Anything you can do, I can do better
[02:43.39]Anything you can do, I can do better
[02:46.19]Anything you can do, I can do better
[02:49.00]Anything you can do, I can do better
[02:51.81]Anything you can do, I can do better
[02:54.61]Anything you can do, I can do better
[02:57.42]Anything you can do, I can do better
[03:00.27]Now, it's all over now
[03:05.54]The sparkle is gone
[03:07.95]See me shimmer o-on
[03:13.17]It's all over now
[03:16.72]The sparkle is gone
[03:19.18]See me shimmer on--
[03:22.33]Now the battle is done,
[03:23.74]Almost thought that I won
[03:25.14]Hard fought, dragged out,
[03:26.37]And it was six against one
[03:27.95]Now you say that we can change
[03:29.35]But you know what's really strange?
[03:30.75]Before this happened,
[03:31.81]No one even cared about my name
[03:33.91]Yeah, you keep your friends, 'til the end
[03:35.67]Let 'em drag you down
[03:36.72]Let 'em all bow to that beautiful crown
[03:39.00]That really should have been mine
[03:40.62]Nah, things will never change
[03:42.16]You stole away my life, and I will never be the same
[03:44.79]And now
[03:46.89]It's all over now
[03:50.40]The sparkle is gone
[03:52.82]See me shimmer o-on
[03:58.08]It's all over now
[04:01.63]The sparkle is gone
[04:04.04]See me shimmer on
[04:09.35]It's all over now
[04:12.86]The sparkle is gone
[04:15.23]See me shimmer o-on
[04:20.54]It's all over now
[04:24.09]The sparkle is gone
[04:26.54]See me shimmer o-on
