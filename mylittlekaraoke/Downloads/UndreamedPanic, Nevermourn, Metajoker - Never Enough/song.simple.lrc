[00:30.92]Don't you know who you are?
[00:34.36]I'm waiting for a new start
[00:38.23]Dreaming of a new heart
[00:41.41]Just praying for real love~
[00:45.27]The days are ringing hollow
[00:48.91]Like there is no tomorrow
[00:52.05]No path for me to follow
[00:55.92]Just waiting for real love~
[01:00.04]I don't want to miss you
[01:03.53]But I could never kiss you
[01:07.09]Not after all I've lived through
[01:09.63]And all~ you do
[01:14.55]What's the worth of a word
[01:17.81]Or all the words in the world?
[01:21.64]Or all the worlds in the universe
[01:24.78]When it can't get worse, no
[01:29.17]What's the worth of my love
[01:32.54]'Cause I was never enough
[01:35.95]You know it's true~
[01:39.17]I was never enough for you
[02:41.83]Don't you know who I am?
[02:45.50]I don't know if you can
[02:48.49]I'm the shadow of a dead man
[02:52.09]Just praying for real love~
[02:56.18]But I am more than you know
[02:59.86]And I know I can let you go~
[03:03.45]No more taking things slow~
[03:06.67]Just waiting for real love~
[03:10.95]I could never miss you
[03:14.36]And I could never kiss you
[03:17.58]Not after all I've lived through
[03:20.54]And all~ you do
[03:25.46]What's the worth of a word
[03:28.91]Or all the words in the world?
[03:32.54]Or all the worlds in the universe
[03:35.69]When it can't get worse~, no
[03:40.04]What's the worth of my love
[03:43.45]'Cause I was never enough
[03:46.86]You know it's true~
[03:50.08]I was never enough for~ you
