A million stars, shine like spotlights
But not as much as you
In the most bashful walk, under the branch
I ask "Is there room for two?"
Talking like I'm robust, when more than anything
I wish someone would take me under their wing
Tired and freezing, but still here, in spite
For one who is only awake at night
The sight of you sure brightens up every night
More than the sun ever could
So how about it?
A colony of just me~ and you
You're the moonlight that shines my way back home
When I don't know what to do
They say "Early to bed and early to rise
Makes a stallion healthy, and wealthy and wise"
But do you mind if I stay with you?
A colony
Of just me~ and you
A million thoughts run through my~ head
Of what I should say
My heart audible when I see you in my dreams
And when I think of you every day
I have come quite a way, in this night cold as stone
Hoping that when I see~ you, that you'd be alone
The closer I am, the slower I'll walk
Though my heart is striking, I'm still in shock
The sight of you, just shatters away my fatigue
More than daylight ever has
How about it?
A colony of just me~ and you
You're the moonlight that shines my way back home
When I don't know what to do
They say "Early to bed and early to rise
Makes a stallion healthy, and wealthy and wise"
But I'd stay up all night with you
A colony of just me~ and you
Woahohwoahoh
Just me~ and you
Woahohwoahoh
Just me and you
The perfect night sky, can only revolve around you
No one else but you
No one else but you
The stars live to spotlight you
If you'd let me
A colony of just me and you
Leave our worries behind, take the whole world by storm
Immersing in every view
They say "Early to bed and early to rise
Makes a stallion healthy, and wealthy and wise"
But I'll stay up all night with you
A colony of just me~ and you
Woahohwoahoh
Just me~ and you
Woahohwoahoh
Just me and you
Ohoh, just me and~ you
Just me~ and you
