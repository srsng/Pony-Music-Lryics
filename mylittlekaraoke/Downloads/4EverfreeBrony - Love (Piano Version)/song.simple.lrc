[00:13.55]I can't belie-eve that I thought it'd be easy
[00:16.84]I guess no one's perfe-ect
[00:20.12]I was dece-eived by a thing we call dreamin'
[00:23.37]'Cause I thought I co-ouldn't hurt i-it
[00:26.70]Now look at me-e, it's so easy to see-ee
[00:30.19]Something's hi-idin' what I asked fo-or
[00:33.27]It's been ye-ears no-ow
[00:36.11]And I'm still seekin' it o-out
[00:40.47]Ma-aybe I'm~ only-y stuck
[00:47.04]O-on my o-own cloud a-above
[00:53.21]Maybe it's okay
[00:54.64]Or maybe I'm insane
[00:56.90]Maybe it's meant to be so-o tough
[01:00.19]Whoa-oh-oh-ohâ€“oh-oh-oh-oh
[01:03.27]Or maybe all I need is love
[01:09.11]Ooh, ye-e-e-eah
[01:16.47]Oh-oh wo-oah, o-o-o-oh
[01:23.00]Whoa-oh wo-o-oah
[01:27.32]All I ne-eed is lo-o-o-o-ove
[01:32.66]Once aga-ain, I can feel myself fadin'
[01:35.70]But I see a ne-ew life being co-o-lo-oured in
[01:39.23]I can te-ell that my heart is done achin'
[01:42.27]But I wonder if I've gained ano~ther skin
[01:45.60]I can't stop this transformation
[01:48.44]An odd sensation's takin' me fo-or a~ ride
[01:52.79]All~ the way ba-ack through my-y mind~
[01:59.41]Ma-aybe I'm~ only-y stuck
[02:05.95]O-on my o-own cloud a-above
[02:12.11]Maybe it's okay
[02:13.55]Or maybe I'm insane
[02:15.81]Maybe it's meant to be so-o tough
[02:19.10]Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:22.18]Or maybe all I need is love
[02:27.77]Ooh, yeah, ye-eah
