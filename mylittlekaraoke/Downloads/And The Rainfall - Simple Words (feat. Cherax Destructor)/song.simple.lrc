[00:17.13]It hasn't been nearly long enough
[00:20.94]But I seem to be doing alright
[00:25.26]I was today; I made my meals~~
[00:33.61]Some days I can't be sure
[00:36.70]That I'm out of my curse
[00:38.48]That I can't go back again~
[00:41.53]I secretly hope I won't~ if I~ try~
[01:05.69]I see friendly faces from time to time~
[01:10.01]Some days it's hard to even stand upright~
[01:14.03]Some days are better
[01:19.16]I even go outside
[01:55.05]Maybe it's true that time heals all wounds
[01:59.12]Maybe it works both ways
[02:03.19]One fate for me and for the rest of us
[02:06.49]Where consequence is a novel idea~
[02:11.07]And it still feels like~
[02:15.13]Another encore's a blink away~
[02:18.65]There's something better ahead
[02:20.94]And it's waiting for me
[02:25.77]Wait for me
[02:44.08]Along the streets that saw me die~
[02:47.63]The rain is dancing under the sun~
[02:51.19]It washed away~ all the blood and the death
[02:54.24]And all that's left is all the time that is mine
[02:57.30]I can wait~ for peace to catch up with my head
[03:02.38]For the surprises up ahead~
[03:06.45]For the decisions left to make
[03:10.52]For all the love left to give~
[03:14.84]And I know it's been~ rough
[03:16.74]And I can't say enough
[03:18.61]And neither can I pretend
[03:20.73]That I understand
[03:22.68]But if you put your trust in me
[03:26.24]I'll show you how special your time can be
[03:30.56]And even if I can't know what it's like
[03:32.97]Because your life's not mine
[03:34.96]I can show you that I care
[03:37.00]For you I'm always there
[03:38.99]You have someone to help you see things through
[03:42.55]If you believe in me I'll be good to you too
[04:03.65]I don't want to be lonely
[04:08.69]I'll stay, I'll stay, with you
[04:11.83]When I feel like I'm falling
[04:16.87]I'll stay, I'll stay, with you
[04:19.92]When the nightmares get to me
[04:24.96]I'll stay, I'll stay, with you
[04:28.06]When I feel too tired to breathe~~~~
[04:33.14]I'll stay, I'll stay, with you~~
[04:37.46]'Cause in this time~line~
[04:41.79]We've got a shot at a happy ending
[04:45.60]The rest can wait until tomorrow
[04:53.82]And it still feels~ like~
[04:57.97]Another encore's a blink away~
[05:01.87]But it can wait until tomorrow
[05:16.83]I don't want to be lonely
[05:21.96]I'll stay, I'll stay, with you~~
[05:26.07]I'll stay, I'll stay
[05:29.88]Oh I'll stay, I'll stay, with you~~
[05:34.12]I'll stay, I'll stay
[05:38.23]I'll stay, I'll stay, with you~~
