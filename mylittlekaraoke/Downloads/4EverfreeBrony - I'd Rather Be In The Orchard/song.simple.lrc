[00:26.85]Back on the road of adventure
[00:30.49]Saving the world yet again
[00:34.12]Faking the smile for the goodbye
[00:37.76]Why do I have to pretend?
[00:41.40]Don't get me wro-ong, I belong here
[00:45.03]Facing the fire with my friends
[00:48.22]But I always look forward to afte-er it a-all ends
[00:56.62]I'd rather be in the o-orchard
[01:03.90]Kickin' the trees while the su-un sets
[01:10.94]Oh, I'd rather be with my family
[01:18.22]But I know that he-ere i-is whe-ere they ne-eed me
[01:35.94]Brother can handle the harvest
[01:39.58]Sister can grow on her own
[01:43.22]Granny will keep things in o-order
[01:46.85]Good thing they're not all alone
[01:50.49]Don't get me wro-ong, it's a pleasure
[01:53.90]To wander aro-ound every land
[01:57.31]But I often wish I had my own roof ove-erhead
[02:05.72]I'd rather be in the o-orchard
[02:12.99]Kickin' the trees while the su-un sets
[02:20.03]Oh, I'd rather be with my family
[02:27.27]But I know that here i-is whe-ere they need me-e-e
[02:34.81]I'd rather be in the o-orchard
[02:42.08]Kickin' the trees while the su-un sets
[02:49.12]Oh, I'd rather be with my family
[02:56.40]But I know that he-ere i-is where they need me
