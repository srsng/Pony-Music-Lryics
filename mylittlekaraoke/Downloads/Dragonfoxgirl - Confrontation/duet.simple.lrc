[00:04.16][P1] It's over now, I kno-ow inside
[00:11.70][P1] No one will never know
[00:16.87][P1] The sorry tale of Nightmare Moon
[00:22.12][P1] And those who died
[00:25.54][P1] No one must ever know
[00:32.59][P1] They only see the tragedy
[00:39.37][P1] They not see my intent
[00:44.70][P1] The shadow of Night's evil
[00:49.20][P1] Will forever kill the good that I have meant
[01:00.56][P1] Am I~ a go-ood mare?
[01:06.86][P1] Am I~ a ma-ad mare?
[01:12.56][P1] It's such a fi-ine line~
[01:17.13][P1] Betwe-een a good ma-are a-and I
[01:30.33][P2] Do you even think that I would ever let you go~?
[01:36.71][P2] Do you even think that I would set you free-ee?
[01:43.12][P2] If you do, I'm sad to say it simply isn't so
[01:49.50][P2] You will never get away fro-om me
[01:55.76][P1] All that you are is a face in a mirror
[01:58.80][P1] I close my eyes and you disappear!
[02:01.87][P2] I'm what you face when you face in the mirror
[02:04.80][P2] Long as you live I will still be here!
[02:07.80][P1] All that you are is the end of a Nightmare
[02:10.76][P1] All that you are is a dying scream~
[02:13.65][P1] After tonight I shall end these demon dream!
[02:19.46][P2] This is not a dream, my dear, and it will never e-end
[02:25.61][P2] This one is the nightmare that goes~ on~~
[02:31.65][P2] I am here to stay, no matter what you may pretend
[02:37.76][P2] And I'll flourish long after yo-ou're gone
[02:44.21][P1] Soon you will die and my silence will hide you!
[02:47.17][P1] You cannot choose but to lose control!
[02:50.02][P2] You can't control me, I live deep inside you,
[02:52.95][P2] Each day you feel me devour your soul!
[02:55.84][P1] I don't need you to survive as you need me
[02:58.76][P1] I'll become whole, lest you dance with death
[03:01.72][P1] And I'll rejoice as you breathe your fina-al breath!
[03:07.84][P2] I~ live insi-ide yo-ou forever~!
[03:12.11][P1] No!
[03:13.46][P2] The darkness, itself by my si-ide
[03:17.44][P1] No!
[03:18.34][P2] And I'll kno-ow that now a-and forever
[03:23.51][P2] They'll never be able to sepa-arate Luna from Night~!
[03:31.31][P1] Can't you see it's:
[03:34.05][P1] Over now~!
[03:35.44][P1] It's time to die!
[03:37.20][P2] No, not I~, only yo-ou!
[03:40.35][P1] If I die, you die too!
[03:43.23][P2] You die. Me? I'll BE you!
[03:46.80][P1] Damn you Night! Set me free!
[03:50.06][P2] Can't you see? You ARE me!
[03:53.44][P1] No! Deep insideâ€¦
[03:56.70][P2] I am you. You are Night!
[04:00.60][P1] No! Never!
[04:01.91][P2] Yes. Forever!
[04:04.01][P1] God damn you Nightmare,
[04:05.73][P1] Take all your evil deeds and run to Tartarus!
[04:06.97][P2] Muhuhahahahahahaha
[04:09.45][P2] I'll see you there, Luna.
[04:11.62][P1] Never!
