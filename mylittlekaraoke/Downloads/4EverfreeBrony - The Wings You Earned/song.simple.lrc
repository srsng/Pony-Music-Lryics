[00:54.63]One day soon I know you'll~ see
[01:00.63]Raise your head and smile~ for me
[01:06.63]Laugh about~ our histo~ry
[01:12.63]Know just what you're meant to be
[01:32.04]You sigh and always try to play it cool~
[01:38.93]But deep inside you still feel like a fool
[01:45.81]The world's so big and you, you feel so~ small
[01:52.87]Wondering if you should try~ at all
[01:59.31]But tomorrow's not til today is~ gone
[02:05.75]Live the mo~ment, don't take~ long
[02:11.53]Forget the trou~bles you think~ on
[02:17.75]Smile~ for impending~ dawn
[02:24.63]Is it time to break the mold?
[02:28.03]Are you doing what you're told?

[02:38.31]When the final days have come
[02:41.66]Smile at the mile's~ you have run
[02:45.15]Come on have a little fun
[02:48.59]Spread your wings your time has~ come~~~~~!
[03:18.63]Sitting, hoping for the wings you've earned~
[03:25.47]Silent as the fire in you~ burned
[03:32.35]Brush away the dust and~ ash
[03:38.31]On your shoulders from the past~

[03:50.31]Feel the beat~, your dice are~ cast
[03:56.35]Stroke of luck, or fate, re~joice
[04:02.35]Now you finally have a choice~
[04:08.04]So prove them wrong in what they~ say~
[04:14.75]Or wait another day
