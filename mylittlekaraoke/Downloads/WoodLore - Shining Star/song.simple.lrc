[00:11.17]The farm's been doing fi-ine since the spring began
[00:16.78]As good as any other year
[00:22.60]Sales are goin' steady and we're working hard~~
[00:28.29]Nothing's really changing here
[00:34.29]I tend your garden every morn~ing
[00:39.59]Just the way you taught me long ago
[00:45.06]The flowers still remind me of the song~ you used to sing
[00:50.00]When we were out there working hours~ all a~lone
[00:56.48]What I wouldn't give to have you back for just a day
[01:01.95]I miss the way you'd smile when I was~ scared
[01:07.78]All I wanna say is that I hope that I can be
[01:13.29]The shining star that you both were to me
[01:19.16]Applebloom's a little bigger every day
[01:24.59]Had no idea how quick she'd grow
[01:30.41]Lately she's been learning who she wants to be~~
[01:36.32]Could really use her mama though
[01:41.70]Mac sings with a choir~ every Sunday
[01:47.31]First thing that he's done since you've been gone
[01:53.00]Granny's slowin' down but she's still every bit as strong
[01:57.94]As the days when we'd throw horseshoes on the~ lawn
[02:04.25]What I wouldn't give to have you back for just a day
[02:09.72]I miss the way you'd smile when I was~ scared
[02:15.54]All I wanna say is that I hope that I can be
[02:21.06]The shining star that you both were to me
[02:49.29]I wanna hear you tell me that you're proud~ of me
[02:54.94]I wanna feel your warmth against my fur
[03:00.59]I try to be the adult that I know~ that I should be
[03:05.75]But it's hard to fill the hole where you two~ were~~
[03:12.01]What I wouldn't give to have you back for just a day
[03:17.53]I miss the way you'd smile when I was~ scared
[03:23.35]All I wanna say is that I hope that I can be
[03:28.78]The shining star that you both were to me
[03:34.64]All I wanna say is that I hope that I can be
[03:40.20]The shining star that you both were to me
