I can't believe that I thought it'd be easy
Well I guess that no~one's perfect
I was deceieved by a thing we call dreamin'
'Cause I thought I couldn't hurt it
Now look at me, it's so easy to se
Something's hidin' what I asked for
It's been years now
And I'm still seekin' it out
Maybe I'm~ only~ stuck
Oon my own cloud above
Maybe it's okay
Or maybe I'm insane
Maybe it's meant to be so tough
Woahohoh, or maybe all I need is love
Ooh yeah, woah
All I need is love
Woahohoh, oh
Ooh, woah
Ooh, all I ned is
Once again, I can feel myself fadin'
But I see a new life being colored in
I can tell that my heart is done achin'
But I wonder if I've gained another skin
I can't stop this transformation
An odd sensation's takin' me for a~ ride
All the way back through my~ mind
Maybe I'm~ only~ stuck
Oon my own cloud above
Maybe it's okay
Or maybe I'm insane
Maybe it's meant to be so tough
Woahohoh, or maybe all I~ need is love
Ooh yeah, woahoh, oh
Ooh, all I ned is
Love
Oh, yeah
Oh, ah
All I~ ned is
Love
Maybe I'm~ only~ stuck
Oon my own cloud above
Maybe it's okay
Or maybe I'm insane
Maybe it's meant to be so tough
Woahohoh, or maybe all I~ need is
Love
