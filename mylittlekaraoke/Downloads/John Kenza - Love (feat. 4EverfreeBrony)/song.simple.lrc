[00:12.23]I can't belie-eve that I thought it'd be easy
[00:15.23]Well I guess that no~-one's perfe-ect
[00:18.23]I was decei-ieved by a thing we call dreamin'
[00:21.23]'Cause I thought I co-ouldn't hurt i-it
[00:24.23]Now look at me-e, it's so easy to se-ee
[00:27.42]Something's hi-idin' what I asked fo-or
[00:30.23]It's been ye-ears now
[00:32.86]And I'm still seekin' it o-out
[00:36.79]Ma-aybe I'm~ only~ stuck
[00:42.79]O-on my o-own cloud a-a-bo-ove
[00:48.42]Maybe it's okay
[00:49.73]Or maybe I'm insane
[00:51.79]Maybe it's meant to be so-o tough
[00:54.79]Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, or maybe all I need is love

[01:51.23]But I see a ne-ew life being co-olored in
[01:54.42]I can te-ell that my heart is done achin'
[01:57.23]But I wonder if I've gained ano-other skin
[02:00.23]I can't stop this transformation
[02:02.86]An odd sensation's takin' me fo-or a~ ride
[02:06.79]All the way ba-ack through my~ mi-ind
[02:12.79]Ma-aybe I'm~ only~ stuck
[02:18.79]O-on my o-own cloud a-a-bo-ove
[02:24.42]Maybe it's okay
