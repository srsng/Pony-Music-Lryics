[00:13.78]There's so much about myself~ I never knew
[00:17.64]And so much I ne~ver would have~ known~
[00:23.43]Without you
[00:27.53]It's crazy to think I've come~ this far
[00:30.93]For most of my life I felt~ it'd be too~ hard~
[00:36.71]Then I found you
[00:41.86]This far-less ta~ken path is long and winding~
[00:47.64]But now the journey doesn't feel so thank~less
[00:50.64]Thanks to your pa~tience
[00:54.93]I can't help feeling weight~less
[00:57.50]When you~ believe~ in~ me
[01:01.78]And when I fall~ a~gain~
[01:05.00]I know you'll be~ my friend
[01:08.43]So tha~-a-a~-a-ank you, for your pa~tience
[01:22.36]For far too long I'd bathed~ in lies
[01:25.78]You came along and proved~ how I could~ live~
[01:31.57](How life could be)
[01:36.07]It took so much belief~ in me
[01:39.50]You said it would be worth~ it, now I~ see
[01:45.28](And now I~ see)
[01:50.43]This far-less ta~ken path
[01:53.00]Is long and winding~
[01:56.21]But now the journey doesn't feel so thank~less
