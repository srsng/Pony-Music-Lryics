[00:16.10]Eight legs, I guess you choose who you choose
[00:19.94]Four eyes, you always win or you lose
[00:23.78]Sometimes I feel it's not worth helping
[00:31.46]I know I may be one of a kind
[00:35.06]And it's strange to think she'd give me a try
[00:38.90]But it's still a little underwhelming
[00:46.82]I'll never know
[00:49.70]the feeling of bei-ing loved
[00:54.26]And I'll never feel
[00:57.38]the warmth of the sun abo-ove
[01:02.18]My heart is cold,
[01:05.06]and my soul is growi-ing o-old
[01:10.10]But I'll still be wa-aiti-ing for the day when she'll say
[01:14.66]The day when she'll say hello
[01:22.34]The day when she'll say hello
[01:32.90]So hard to see her all of the time
[01:36.74]Outside tending all other kinds
[01:40.58]Feels like another helpless story
[01:48.26]I've dreamt of one day catching her eye
[01:52.10]With her attention only-y mi-ine
[01:55.70]But it's still a little too much for me
[02:03.62]I'll never know
[02:06.50]the feeling of bei-ing loved
[02:11.06]And I'll never feel
[02:14.18]the warmth of the sun abo-ove
[02:18.98]My heart is cold,
[02:21.86]and my soul is growi-ing o-old
[02:26.90]But I'll still be wa-aiti-ing for the day when she'll say
[02:31.46]The day when she'll say hello
[02:42.26]But I'll still be wa-aiti-ing for the day when she'll say
[02:46.82]The day when she'll say hello
