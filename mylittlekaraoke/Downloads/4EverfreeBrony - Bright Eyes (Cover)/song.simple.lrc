[00:07.27]She looks outsi-ide her wi-indow at the rising sun
[00:10.88]And she also looks at the same ti-ime at her beloved one
[00:15.33]Dinky's sorting out the mail for her in such a thoughtful wa-ay
[00:22.83]She saddles up her ba-ags and
[00:25.05]Peeks through the looking glass
[00:26.71]And hears her daughter say
[00:29.49]"Hey Mommy, can you se-ee how good you look today?
[00:33.38]Your right eye has a sparkle, and the left one wants to play
[00:37.83]Your mane looks extra shiny and your feathers extra so-oft
[00:44.49]Your cutie mark reminds me that our love will never pop!"
[00:48.66]Oh-oh-oh, Ditzy Doo~!
[00:50.88]All the world's in love with you
[00:53.10]It's like you're a fresh baked muffi-in
[00:55.33]And the-e rest of us a-are you
[00:57.55]Oh-oh-oh, De-er-py~
[00:59.77]Te-ell me, can those bright eyes see?
[01:02.55]You make living happie-er for everypo-ony
[01:07.27]She takes off down the ro-oad, in
[01:09.49]Search of the day's first ho-ome and
[01:11.71]Although it takes a mo-oment, she spots the boutique
[01:16.16]A white mare canters o-out and
[01:18.38]Her lips rise from a po-out when
[01:20.60]She cannot help but shout "Hello!" to that gray streak
[01:25.05]Then in the ma-ar-ket-pla-ace where
[01:27.30]Every eye knows her fa-ace, she's
[01:29.49]Greeted by the-eir good grace, and
[01:31.64]She-e has none to spare
[01:33.97]A farm mare selling apples
[01:36.12]Tosses our friend a ha-atful
[01:38.38]It's more than she can grapple,
[01:40.19]But she tha-anks the mare
[01:42.83]Though she's a little wo-onky,
[01:45.05]Each pony a-and each do-onkey
[01:47.27]Together and all o-on key
[01:49.21]Sing her a song
[01:50.88]Oh-oh-oh, Ditzy Doo~!
[01:53.10]All the world's in love with you
