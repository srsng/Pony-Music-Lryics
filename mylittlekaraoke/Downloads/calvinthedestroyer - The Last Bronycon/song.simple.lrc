[00:17.26]When the last ceremony starts
[00:22.23]With the last crowd to attend
[00:27.29]And the last guest come out
[00:32.27]For the fandom we defend
[00:37.01](They) come from far away land
[00:42.07]Though we have done this before
[00:47.21]We will be all the Bronies
[00:51.54]At the last Bronycon
[00:59.17]When the first panel opens
[01:03.91]To start the week-end one last time
[01:09.05]And you look at the schedule
[01:13.79]And realize how time is flying
[01:19.01]And it seems the world is ending
[01:23.99]Leaving just your friends to mourn
[01:28.56]We join together in friendship
[01:33.22]Of the last Bronycon
[01:38.20]I'm alive
[01:43.10]I'm ali~~ve
[01:55.38]When the last ice cold water
[02:00.28]Sends us off on the last morning
[02:05.34]And the days in Bal timare pass
[02:09.92]With out a last desperate warning
[02:15.22]Then look to the memories
[02:20.11]And where all friend ships were born
[02:24.77]Remember how~ it started
[02:29.03]Enjoy the last Bronycon
[02:34.17]I'm alive
[02:39.07]I'm ali~~ve
