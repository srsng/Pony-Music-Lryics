[00:54.98]There's a chance~ that I could fall
[00:57.69]And no-ot co-ome back
[01:00.98]I'd never~ regret a thing
[01:04.07]I'd never get back on track
[01:07.37]Darkness all around me
[01:09.69]I can't find the light
[01:11.82]I let it all surround me
[01:14.33]Giving up without a fight
[01:18.01]The bitterness and pain inside
[01:21.30]Countless tears I had to cry
[01:24.40]I was facing all my fears
[01:27.11]Just to let you in to dry my tears, but
[01:30.98]Your ki-indness won't betra-ay me
[01:34.07]I fe-eel your heart and so-oul
[01:37.17]Your ki-indness still can save me
[01:40.27]I choose to not let go
[01:43.37]Stretching out you somehow reach me
[01:46.46]I kno-ow this can't be wro-ong
[01:49.56]I'm re-ea-dy, won't you teach me
[01:53.04]Your song of~ ki-indness
[02:00.01]Quiet gra-ace surrounds you
[02:02.72]And helps me find my-y own
[02:05.43]I can't tell you how you've helped me
[02:09.11]And how much I~ have grown
[02:11.62]Even though you're far away
[02:14.72]Inspiration comes from you
[02:17.24]To shine a little brighter every day
[02:20.91]If you only knewâ€¦
[02:23.04]And I will never get upset
[02:25.75]And I~ will ne-ever, ever forget
[02:29.04]The happiness you made me feel
[02:32.14]Almost as if you're actually re-eal, but
[02:37.56]Your ki-indness won't betra-ay me
[02:40.66]I fe-eel your heart and so-oul
[02:43.75]Your ki-indness still can save me
[02:46.85]I choose to not let go
[02:49.95]Stretching out you somehow reach me
[02:53.04]I kno-ow this can't be wro-ong
[02:56.14]I'm re-ea-dy, won't you teach me
[02:59.62]Your song of~ ki-indness
[03:30.20]Your ki-indness won't betra-ay me
[03:33.49]I feel your heart and your so-o-oul
[03:36.40]Your ki-indness still can save me
[03:39.49]In a way you'll never know
[03:42.59]Your ki-indness won't betra-ay me
[03:45.69]I fe-eel your heart and so-oul
[03:48.78]Your ki-indness still can save me
[03:51.88]I choose to not let go
[03:54.98]Stretching out you somehow reach me
[03:58.07]I kno-ow this can't be wro-ong
[04:01.17]I'm re-ea-dy, won't you teach me
[04:04.27]The way to get a-along
[04:07.37]Even whe-en the cold wind's blowing
[04:10.46]And I want to just give i-in
[04:13.56]It warms my heart just knowing
[04:16.66]I'll hear your voice a-again
[04:19.75]So won't you sing it loud
[04:22.85]And won't you sing it lo-ong
[04:25.95]I pro-omise to reme-ember
[04:29.48]Your song of~ ki-indness
[04:44.57]I pro-omise to remem~be~-er
[04:50.72]I pro-omise to remem~be~-erâ€¦
