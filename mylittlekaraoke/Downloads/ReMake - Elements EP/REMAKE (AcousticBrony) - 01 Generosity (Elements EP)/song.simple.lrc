[01:32.78]The da-ay begins
[01:35.48]She'll make herself~ look pure
[01:39.98]I know she'll turn some heads
[01:44.48]Of tha-a-at I'm sure
[01:47.48]Now you know she's looking fine
[01:51.08]All so divine~, all so~ sublime
[01:54.68]She'll get to wo-ork
[01:56.52]Don't you know a stitch in time saves ni-i-i-ine?
[02:09.08]When they all see her come around
[02:12.68]You know there's something there to be found~
[02:15.98]A lush beau~ty, like a diamond~ ring
[02:19.88]Of the highest Rarity
[02:23.48]And even more beautiful inside
[02:27.08]Reach way down deep and I'm sure you'll fi-ind
[02:30.53]That she can~ bring, that little some~thing
[02:34.02]Called Generosi~ty
[02:42.98]So e~legant
[02:45.38]As she waltzes across~ the room
[02:50.52]Watch her shine now
[02:54.68]Her time it will come soon
[02:57.68]Now let's use just what we know
[03:01.32]Come on now let's go~, go, go
[03:04.88]And dance the night~ away
[03:07.28]Until we all have to go ho-o-o-o-o-ome

[03:59.52]I'll stick by you forever and every single day

[04:07.92]Now come and join me in harmony

[05:47.67]That she can~ bring, that little something
[05:51.12]Called Generosi~ty
