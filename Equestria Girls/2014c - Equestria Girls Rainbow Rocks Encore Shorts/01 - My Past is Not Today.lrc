[00:07.67]Power was all I desired
[00:14.42]But all that grew inside me
[00:18.12]Was the darkness I acquired
[00:22.82]When I began to fall
[00:25.57]And lost the path ahead
[00:30.27]That's when your friendship found me
[00:33.27]And it lifted me instead
[00:37.21]Like a phoenix burning bright in the sky
[00:43.72]I'll show there's another side to me
[00:47.47]You can't deny
[00:52.42]I may not know what the future holds
[00:56.16]But hear me when I say
[00:59.37]That my past does not define me
[01:03.12]Cause my past is not today
[01:09.19]Ambition is what I believed
[01:16.45]Would be the only way to set me free
[01:24.64]But when it disappeard
[01:27.38]And I found myself alone
[01:32.09]That's when you came and got me
[01:35.10]And felt like I was home
[01:38.85]Like a phoenix burning bright
[01:42.06]In the sky
[01:45.51]I'll show there's another side to me
[01:49.26]You can't deny
[01:54.21]I may not know what the future holds
[01:57.95]But hear me when I say
[02:01.21]That my past does not define me
[02:04.95]Cause my past is not today
