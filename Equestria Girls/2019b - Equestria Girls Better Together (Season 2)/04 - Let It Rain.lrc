[00:11.99]It's all right, yeah
[00:16.13]I'm walking right beside you
[00:19.98]I feel the way, feel the way that you do, too
[00:25.92]Oh, I can't lie, sometimes
[00:32.92]Everything feels like it's just too much
[00:35.27]But you gotta let it in, even if it's tough
[00:37.96]Know it gets better, know it gets better
[00:40.49]Push through the weather, weather
[00:42.35]Let it ra-a-a-ain
[00:47.46]Let it ra-a-a-ain
[00:52.52]Don't be afraid of walls coming down
[00:54.99]Sometimes it hurts, you'll figure it out
[00:57.59]Let it ra-a-a-ain
[01:02.62]Let it rain, it's okay
[01:06.82]There's beauty in the breakdown
[01:11.72]There's sun behind those gray clouds
[01:15.36]You know, I can't lie, it's all right
[01:23.49]Everything feels like it's just too much
[01:25.76]But you gotta let it in, even if it's tough
[01:28.35]Know it gets better, know it gets better
[01:30.82]We push through the weather, weather
[01:32.92]Let it ra-a-a-ain
[01:34.52](There's beauty, there's beauty in the breakdown)
[01:38.08]Let it ra-a-a-ain
[01:43.07]Don't be afraid of walls coming down
[01:45.51]Sometimes it hurts, you'll figure it out
[01:48.13]Let it ra-a-a-ain
[01:50.16](There's beauty, there's beauty in the breakdown)
[01:53.29]Let it rain, let it ra-a-a-ain...
