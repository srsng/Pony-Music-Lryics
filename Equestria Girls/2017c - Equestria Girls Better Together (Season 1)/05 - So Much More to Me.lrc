[00:02.06]Do you think the coast is clear?
[00:05.51]No one to see, no one to hear
[00:09.21]Me sing out my song?
[00:13.39]I think we're all alone
[00:16.58]I don't need my name in lights
[00:20.14]That's not where I set my sights
[00:23.18]No, oh-oh, no, not me
[00:27.33]I don't need a stage to sing
[00:29.84]I like the quiet, I like the calm
[00:33.27]To turn it up, to sing along
[00:37.33]I'm not just shy
[00:39.09]Look close, and you will see
[00:42.56]There's so much more to me
[00:45.10]I'm just fine rehearsing on my own
[00:48.53]My hairbrush is my microphone
[00:52.74]Look out now, I'm in the zone
[00:56.97]Yeah! Can you feel it?
[00:59.34]I like the quiet, I like the calm
[01:03.00]To turn it up, to sing along
[01:06.86]I'm not just shy
[01:08.56]Look close, and you will see
[01:12.00]There's so much more to me
[01:14.53]I speak soft out in a crowd
[01:18.03]I whisper, "am I being too loud?"
[01:21.66]But when I close that door
[01:25.31]The crowd, it just wants more and more and mooooore
[01:31.00]I like the quiet, I like the calm (oh-whoa-whoa)
[01:34.55]To turn it up, to sing along
[01:38.00]I'm not just shy
[01:39.92]Look close, and you will see
[01:43.77]There's so much more to me
[01:46.01]I like my friends, I like my pets (oh-whoa-whoa)
[01:49.34]I like to rock, do pirouettes (oh-whoa)
[01:52.88]I'm more than shy
[01:54.58]I'm more than you can see
[01:58.35]There's so much more to me
[02:01.79]
