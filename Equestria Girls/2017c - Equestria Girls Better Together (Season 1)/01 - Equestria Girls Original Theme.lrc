[00:01.29]Oh-oh-oh
[00:02.81]Oh-oh-oh
[00:04.39]You are my Equestria Girls
[00:07.53]Met you and the light switched on
[00:09.83]It brightens up my day like the sun
[00:12.30]When my friends come a-runnin'
[00:15.02]You were right all along

[00:20.06]We could turn a sketch into a masterpiece
[00:23.88]When you're here, I feel like I'm complete
[00:27.55]Every day's a brighter day with you in my life
[00:33.21]And every time we fall, we get back up again
[00:37.15]Look around and you will find a friend
[00:40.85]You are my Equestria Girls

[00:55.82]We'll let the world know, bring our light to the shadows
[01:02.62]Whoa-oh-oh-oh
[01:03.86]Together friends forever
[01:07.13]Each day is now or never
[01:10.53]Just call on me, and you'll find me by your side
[01:15.96]We could turn a sketch into a masterpiece
[01:19.71]When you're here, I feel like I'm complete
[01:23.41]Every day's a brighter day with you in my life
[01:29.07]And every time we fall, we get back up again
