[00:00.81][Wallflower Blush]
[00:02.55]You don't see me fitting in
[00:06.06]I'm sitting here alone
[00:10.40]Right beside my shadow
[00:14.55]Always on my own
[00:18.77]If I could share my wildest dreams
[00:23.13]Maybe they would see
[00:26.61]I'm more than just a wallflower
[00:30.89]There's so much more to me
[00:34.39]I'm invisible, invisible
[00:39.26]A droplet in the mist
[00:43.39]Invisible, invisible
[00:47.48]It's like I don't exist
[00:51.70]Right beneath my picture
[00:56.11]This is what you'll read (Oh oh oh oh o)
[01:00.17]A laundry list of nothings
[01:03.88]Not likely to succeed (Ooh)
[01:08.39]A yearbook with blank pages
[01:12.43]That no one wants to sign
[01:16.48]A memory forgotten
[01:20.85]Until the end of time
[01:24.83]I'm invisible, invisible
[01:28.97]A star fading at down
[01:33.01]Invisible, invisible
[01:37.04]Won't be long before I'm gone
[01:41.70]Won't be long before I'm gone
[01:47.68]
