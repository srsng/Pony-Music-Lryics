[00:16.92]A single rose left to remember
[00:22.50]As a single tear falls from her eye
[00:27.95]Another cold day in December
[00:34.67]A year from the day she said goodbye.
[00:38.85]
[00:39.85]Seems it's only been a moment
[00:44.99]Since the angels took him from her arms
[00:50.85]And she was left there
[00:53.45]Holding on to their tomorrow
[00:57.60]But as they laid him in the ground
[01:03.45]Her heart would sing without a sound
[01:07.42]
[01:08.20]For the first time you can open your eyes
[01:13.16]And see the world without your sorrow
[01:16.28]Where no one knows the pain you left behind
[01:19.77]And all the pecae you could never find
[01:24.25]Is waiting there to hold and keep you
[01:27.77]Welcome to the first day of your life
[01:31.57]Just open up your eyes
[01:38.09]
[01:45.22]A single lifetime lays behind her
[01:50.85]As she draws her final breath
[01:56.70]Just beyond the door he'll find her
[02:02.86]Taking her hand she softly says
[02:07.40]
[02:08.23]For the first time you can open your eyes
[02:12.66]And see the world without your sorrow
[02:16.15]Where no one knows the pain you left behind
[02:19.78]And all the pecae you could never find
[02:24.38]Is waiting there to hold and keep you
[02:27.70]Welcome to the first day of your life
[02:31.54]Just open up your eyes
[02:34.74]As I lay you down tonight
[02:41.44]Safe on the other side,
[02:44.83]No more tears to cry
[02:49.99]
[02:50.90]For the first time you can open your eyes
[02:55.61]And see the world without your sorrow
[02:58.98]Where no one knows the pain you left behind
[03:03.10]And all the peace you could never find
[03:07.12]Is waiting there to hold and keep you
[03:10.52]Welcome to the first day of your life
[03:14.44]Just open up your eyes
[03:20.65]
