[00:01.41]Equestria, the land I love
[00:01.41]小马国 爱之所向
[00:05.75]A land of harmony
[00:05.75]谐律传四方
[00:08.66]Our flag does wave from high above
[00:08.66]团结旗帜 高高飘扬
[00:12.92]For ponykind to see
[00:12.92]众马驻足望
[00:18.53]Equestria, a land of friends
[00:18.53]小马国友谊之邦
[00:22.20]Where ponykind do roam
[00:22.20]众马正徜徉
[00:25.94]They say true friendship never ends
[00:25.94]真挚的友谊永不忘
[00:29.50]Equestria, my home
[00:29.50]小马国 我的故乡
[00:34.32]
