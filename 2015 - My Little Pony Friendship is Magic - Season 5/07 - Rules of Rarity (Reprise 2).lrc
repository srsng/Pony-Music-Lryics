[00:02.53]My favorite moment's when a pony sees it
[00:02.53]让小马身披新装 笑容绽放
[00:07.18]That special gown that she just adores
[00:07.18]我心中的喜悦 甜如糖
[00:11.71]That pony's now in style
[00:11.71]马配衣装若最靓
[00:13.89]My hard work's all worthwhile
[00:13.89]我的努力亦不枉
[00:16.19]Oh, yes, it makes my heart
[00:16.19]这一刻让我心
[00:18.63]My heart just soar!
[00:18.63]我心飞翔
[00:24.61]
