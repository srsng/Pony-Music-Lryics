[00:12.50]A kirin Tale - 鹫溪
[00:12.70]原唱：Daniel Ingram
[00:13.02]Lala la lala la
[00:15.19]La la lala la la
[00:17.58]The kirin used to speak and sing
[00:19.27]We weren't always quiet
[00:21.79]We told stories and funny jokes
[00:23.78]My stand up was a riot
[00:26.56]But then one daya fight broke out
[00:28.80]And hurtful words were said
[00:31.37]Flaring tempers were inflamed
[00:33.45]Destruction quickly spread
[00:36.89]And flaming bred from head to head
[00:38.87]Even burnt our bread
[00:43.84]My happy village lay in ruins
[00:45.91]Relationships got worse
[00:48.68]Spoiler alert we quickly learned
[00:50.52]That words could be a curse
[00:53.15]No more talking yelled our leader
[00:55.06]The last thing said aloud
[00:57.64]Into the stream of silence
[00:59.64]We stepped as a crowd
[01:02.18]The water cooled emotions
[01:04.17]And peace was soon restored
[01:06.53]But with no way to speak my thoughts
[01:08.43]I got super bored
[01:13.50]'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky
[01:16.67]Unless you let it rain
[01:18.23]And shiny apples
[01:19.40]Sometimes come with worms
[01:22.85]But you can't give up your laughter
[01:24.96]'Cause you're scared of a little pain
[01:27.26]It's a lesson that
[01:28.25]The kirin never learned
[01:34.37]I was stuck in silent prison
[01:36.65]With the voices in my head
[01:38.78]'Til I tripped over my salvation
[01:41.14]In a helpful flowerbed
[01:43.65]I found a cure to clear my pipes
[01:45.58]And I became quite chatty
[01:48.06]With years and years of stored up words
[01:50.14]I drove my village batty
[01:52.82]They didn't like my jokes my songs
[01:55.08]And daily dose of news
[01:57.10]The plays I wrotethe speeches spoke
[01:59.49]Variety reviews
[02:01.73]Wrote a story about the kirin
[02:03.32]Who hid below an opera stage
[02:17.94]The village leader made it clear
[02:20.03]I had to make my choice
[02:22.46]I could stay and live with them
[02:24.63]Or I could keep my voice
[02:26.78]So I came herebut left the couch alone
[02:29.65]They're hard to move
[02:31.59]With just the view for company
[02:33.66]Until ya heard me groove
[02:39.55]'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky
[02:42.60]Unless you let it rain
[02:44.32]And candles just won't
[02:45.54]Glow until they've burned
[02:48.93]Noyou can't give up your laughter
[02:50.88]'Cause you're scared of a little pain
[02:53.41]It's a lesson that
[02:54.33]My village never learned
[02:59.27]No matter how hard I schooled them
[03:01.22]Fear of hurt is still what ruled them
[03:03.47]Sometimes you gotta let it raaaaaaaain
[03:12.69]Yeah sometimes you gotta let it rain
